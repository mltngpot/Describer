"CHL program focuses on taking control of Type 2 diabetes, prediabetes; register by Jan. 10","summarize:As part of the Healthy Boiler Program’s physical health pillar, the Center for Healthy Living (CHL) on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus offers a 14–week diabetes program multiple times throughout the year.
Taking Control of My Diabetes (TCMD) is open to all benefits-eligible employees (and dependents covered on a Purdue health plan) from West Lafayette, Purdue Northwest and Purdue Fort Wayne. The program is geared toward those living with Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes or those supporting someone with a diagnosis. The next session begins Jan. 17.
The 14-week virtual lifestyle management program covers a variety of topics related to Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes with a goal of equipping participants with the knowledge and resources needed to manage the disease as best as they can. As a result of the program, participants will understand what diabetes is and how lifestyle changes are part of managing blood glucose.
A pre- and post-program evaluation to measure knowledge and beliefs as well as satisfaction with the program are required.
Participants have access to expert services of the center’s health care professionals, including CHL pharmacists who are specially trained in medication therapy management, as well as program co-leaders Cheryl Laszynski, RN health coach at the CHL, and Megan Shidler, registered dietitian at the CHL.
Eligible participants will receive a glucose meter and test strips to check their blood glucose levels. *Program participants can continue to receive glucose testing supplies post-program if they continue to meet with a health coach on a monthly basis.
Many past program participants have seen improvement in their A1C (blood test that measures a patient’s blood glucose level over the past three months) and more.
Bruce Novak, a limited-term lecturer at Purdue Fort Wayne who has lived with Type 2 diabetes for over 10 years, shared that his experience with the course was exceptional and he benefited from the increased and reinforced knowledge gained throughout the program.
“Diabetes does not go on vacation,” he said. “The more you learn and apply, the better off you are. Diabetes is a constant battle.”
The upcoming session runs Jan. 17 to April 17. Those interested in participating should register by Jan. 10 via the Healthy Boiler Portal. Registration link can be found under the “Healthy Boiler Workshops” section on the portal’s home page. Hover over the “Taking Control of My Diabetes” square and hit “Submit” to register.
“I would highly recommend this class to any diabetic or someone who has been diagnosed as prediabetic,” said Leigh Ann Griffin, senior quality advisor at the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering. Griffin has lived with Type 2 diabetes for approximately 20 years and previously participated in the TCMD program. “I decided that I could benefit from a refresher course of ‘how to act like a diabetic’ by eating and cooking healthy and could use all the assistance I could get with motivating me to exercise. And I didn’t even have a working blood glucose meter anymore, and this class was giving us one for free! So, I signed up. Knowledge is power, and this class provides you with much needed knowledge to properly manage your diabetes.”
Healthy Boiler workshops and lifestyle programs are free to all benefits-eligible faculty and staff and their dependents.
*Individuals living with Type 1 diabetes are able to meet monthly with a health coach but are not required to participate in the 14-week Taking Control of My Diabetes program to take advantage of the test strips and blood glucose meter opportunity. Contact the CHL at 765-494-0111 for more information.

Stay safe and injury-free this winter: Top tips for preventing falls and walking safely,"summarize:As the Indiana winter settles in, Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) is once again sharing safety and walking tips for navigating snowy and icy conditions. To avoid falls and injuries, EHS encourages the campus community to take the following precautions before heading out this season:
Plan ahead for routes and only take cleared and treated surfaces. Use pedestrian subwalks and skywalks to walk to buildings when possible.
Wear appropriate footwear. If wearing ice cleats, be sure to remove them indoors to avoid slipping.
Slow down and take shorter steps to help with traction.
Avoid carrying heavy or awkward loads.
Use handrails when using stairs or ramps.
Consider using an elevator, if available, as indoor stairs may also be wet due to tracked-in snow and ice. Falls on stairs can lead to severe injuries, especially when slippery conditions are present.
Use a door or seat to provide stability when getting in or out of a vehicle as parking lots may be slippery.
The Grounds department may be contacted at 765-494-3087 with questions or requests regarding all snow removal operations. Grounds will then coordinate with other departments to address those questions or requests. Building Services will be responsible for removing snow from building entrances, ramps, steps and sidewalks adjacent to buildings. Contact your building deputy with any questions.
Building Services is currently working to distribute self-serve ice melt buckets to many facilities across campus. Contact Dave Petros, occupational safety specialist, at petros@purdue.edu to request self-serve buckets for a building.
A winter walking safety infographic is also available to print on 11-by-17-inch paper for posting on noticeboards throughout campus buildings.
EHS, Grounds and Building Services are all part of the Administrative Operations organization. The organization supports the university through safe, reliable and transformative services. Informing the campus community on how to stay safe while traveling in winter conditions and assisting with snow removal are just a couple of ways the organization helps power Purdue.",[{'summary_text': 'ice cleats can be removed indoors to avoid slipping . falls on stairs can lead to severe injuries . use handrails when using stairs or ramps .'}]

Purdue receives $25 million grant from Lilly Endowment,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University has received a five-year, $25 million grant from Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment Inc. through its statewide initiative, College and Community Collaboration. The grant will support highly collaborative efforts with community partners to improve early childhood education, child care and transportation access in a seven-county region.
The grant will partially fund investments in and training for local child care centers to provide high-quality services to an additional 500 children in the region, and increase the capacity and availability of early childhood education in Greater Lafayette, including the Purdue campus.
“On behalf of our neighbors and as Indiana’s land-grant university, we thank Lilly Endowment for initiating this program for the state and for choosing our proposal with this generous grant. It is an essential catalyst for transformative change in child care in Greater Lafayette and the nearby region,” President Mung Chiang said. “The availability of early childhood education will be critical to the university’s ability to recruit faculty and staff with young families and to the region’s continued economic growth and job creation. There is no sustainable excellence in ‘gown’ without a vibrant ‘town.’”
The grant will also go toward efforts to improve access to various modes of transportation by supporting renovations at Purdue University Airport to enable commercial service; launch a series of van pools across the seven-county region, which will improve accessibility for workers; and invest in pedestrian safety and bike trail infrastructure, including the Wabash River Trail.
“This multifaceted approach to improve regional transportation will have wide-ranging benefits that improve the vibrancy of our community by boosting workforce development efforts,” Roberto Gallardo, Purdue vice president for engagement, said. “It will also enhance quality of life, which is essential to attracting and retaining talent.”
Purdue is one of six Indiana higher education institutions receiving implementation grants totaling $145.8 million through Lilly Endowment’s competitive initiative. Lilly Endowment anticipates making additional grants through the CCC initiative in 2024.
“In designing their proposed projects, it was evident that these colleges and universities engaged a wide-ranging group of community stakeholders to imagine and develop creative solutions to pressing campus and community needs,” said Jennett M. Hill, president of Lilly Endowment. “The institutions submitted proposals that revealed robust collaborative efforts reflective of the institutions’ willingness to learn from not only campus colleagues but from local residents and businesses to help shape projects with promising potential to enhance the quality of life on their campuses and in their local communities.”
Lilly Endowment launched College and Community Collaboration in early 2023. The initiative is designed to encourage Indiana’s colleges and universities to work closely with community stakeholders to envision and jointly undertake significant community development efforts to create more vibrant places in which to live, learn, work and play.
“We were very appreciative to be part of the planning group that worked with Purdue to outline the needs of the Greater Lafayette region and pleased with the proposal that Purdue put forward. Thank you to Lilly Endowment for funding the proposal and we are looking forward to working together as a region with Purdue University.”

Racing executives cite critical workforce need during visit to Purdue University in Indianapolis,"summarize:INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. —
At the first motorsports symposium at Purdue University in Indianapolis, a wide array of topics were on the table. While machine learning and AI, electrification and hybrid technologies, driver safety, and autonomous racing were all discussed, one thing was made clear: the critical need for a skilled workforce.
Purdue University in Indianapolis motorsports engineering students and graduates took the first step toward filling that void by connecting in person with potential employers on Dec. 6 at the Lilly Auditorium in Indianapolis. Spearheaded by motorsports engineering program director Chris Finch and associate professor Hamid Dalir, the symposium put Boilermakers in front of industry leaders from racing teams like Andretti Global, manufacturers like Dallara USA and Goodyear Racing, and cutting-edge innovators from the Auto Research Center.
“The goal of this symposium was to provide a platform for motorsport industry leaders to highlight the research and educational requirements of the industry,” Finch said. “It gave our faculty and students a great networking opportunity and better understanding of the unique technical nature of working in motorsports.”

During the symposium, which included keynote presentations, a question-and-answer panel and several informal networking opportunities, the workforce subject repeatedly arose. Alex Timmermans, chief engineer at Dallara USA, said finding qualified applicants was one of his biggest challenges. Other panelists, such as Henri Kowalczyk, echoed those sentiments.
“In my 20 years, the hardest part of my job has been finding skilled talent,” said Kowalczyk, chief operating officer at Auto Research Center. “It definitely helps knowing the background of the (Purdue) program as these students rise to the top of our resume list.”
Purdue University in Indianapolis has helped address workforce concerns as the nation’s only ABET-accredited undergraduate motorsports engineering program. Between its campuses in Indianapolis and West Lafayette, Purdue has propelled students and graduates to impactful careers in the highest levels of racing, including NASCAR, IndyCar and the International Motor Sports Association.
That impact isn’t limited to just the track, as many have gone on to work for manufacturers in the motorsports space such as Cummins, a global power technology leader, and Dallara USA. At Dallara, five of its seven full-time engineers are graduates from the Purdue engineering programs in Indianapolis.
The motorsports industry’s influence is particularly felt in Indiana, where hundreds of employers and thousands of jobs, which exceed the state average wage, are located within the state’s borders. That leads to $2 billion in annual economic impact for the state, Rollie Helmling, senior advisor for motorsports at the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, told symposium attendees.
Thanks to world-class facilities like the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway and Lucas Oil Indianapolis Raceway Park in Brownsburg, nearly a dozen NTT IndyCar Series teams have offices in central Indiana, and several NHRA teams, like Tony Stewart Racing and John Force Racing, are based in the area. The headquarters for both Dallara USA and Allison Transmission are less than five miles from the physical footprint of what will become the Purdue University in Indianapolis campus in 2024.
“Being in such proximity to the heart of the motorsports industry is a real advantage that allows us to connect students with potential employers right in our backyard,” said Dan Hasler, chief operating officer of Purdue University in Indianapolis. “We can bring in students from all over the country to our motorsports engineering program, and they can stay to pursue their racing dreams right here in Indiana.”
Purdue University in Indianapolis is a new, fully integrated extension of the West Lafayette flagship campus, expanding the academic rigor and accessible excellence that Purdue is known for to Indiana’s industrial and technological center. As the only public top 10 university, most trusted university and most innovative university in the state of Indiana, Purdue is focused and committed to strengthening its presence in the capital city. Purdue University in Indianapolis will reimagine a collaborative platform that connects students, faculty and local businesses to promote breakthrough discoveries and create a new and direct talent pipeline. Realignment of the existing IUPUI partnership is expected to be completed by the start of the fall semester in 2024.

Office of Future Engineers’ Lindsay Elias receives 2023 Martin Award,"summarize:Lindsay Elias is driven by connections. Whether she’s engaging with the thousands of prospective students and families who step into the Office of Future Engineers each year or mentoring the 20-plus undergraduate engineering peer counselors she oversees, Elias strives to create positive and meaningful interactions that dig deeper than casual conversation.
“It’s a joy to come in every day and do what I do,” Elias says. “I can’t imagine coming to work and not connecting with others. My goal in life is to leave anyone that I meet feeling better than before they met me.”
Elias was recently named the winner of the university’s 2023 Eudoxia Girard Martin Memorial Staff Recognition Award, an honor that recognizes a full-time administrative assistant on the West Lafayette campus who demonstrates qualities of heart, mind and spirit that evince a love for and helpfulness to students, faculty and staff.
Amy Boyle, vice president for human resources, presented the award to Elias on Dec. 4 in the Purdue Memorial Union. It consists of a medallion, a framed description of Eudoxia Girard Martin’s life and a $1,000 honorarium.
When she stepped into the role of office manager nearly 10 years ago, Elias was supported by two student staff members in the Office of Future Engineers. Knowing she needed more hands on deck to manage the office’s growing workload, Elias slowly expanded her team of peer counselors by personally interviewing, hiring and onboarding each one. She teaches them how to interact with prospective students and families, give recruitment presentations, complete reports and answer emails and phone calls — all skills that build their ability to serve as ambassadors and leaders in the college recruitment process.
“I don’t know how I could do it without them,” Elias says. “I want to provide a safe space for them and a place where they can grow and learn, and it became kind of a mission of mine to help them help us. Regardless of the careers they choose, they’re always going to use the skills that we teach them.”
But she’s not just an office manager; she’s the go-to person for her team of student workers, many of whom often simply refer to her as their Purdue mom. Elias’ nurturing and supportive leadership style has created a safe space for students in the office — a space and face they can turn to no matter what hardships they’re up against.
Letters supporting Elias’ nomination underscored her unwavering kindness and empathy toward students and her ability to selflessly advocate for them in and out of the office.
“From the moment I started working for her, she became like a second family to me,” one student nominator said. “She has a remarkable ability to be the mom students under her need at school. Lindsay possesses the patience of a saint, the determination of a true leader and the remarkable ability to make everyone feel like they truly belong.”
Even when her students move on from their roles and pursue their post-graduation plans, many return to visit Elias and celebrate their victories with her. Those who can’t make it to campus set up regular calls with her — a scheduled time to just chat about where life has led them. Every week, Elias meets, texts or chats with at least one of her former students. She not only welcomes it; she looks forward to it.
“They will always have a family and a group of people who care about them who they can turn to no matter where they are or when it is in their lives,” Elias says. “We hear a lot about the Purdue family, and I think the Office of Future Engineers is such a good representation of what that really means.”
This isn’t Elias’ first time being recognized for her work at Purdue. In 2022, she was the recipient of the Rose Award, presented to Elias by the Barbara Cook Chapter of Mortar Board for her willingness to go above and beyond in her role. And in 2016, she was honored with two College of Engineering Awards of Excellence focused on customer service and teamwork.
Every award she’s received has been special, but this one is truly reflective of the care she has for those who work in her office. And to Elias, that’s the greatest gift of all.
“My students know they have a home here and someone they can go to for advice,” Elias says. “They know they’re not going to be judged, and they know I’m going to be honest with them. This award means so much to me because it shows that they know how much I care about them. To me, that’s more important than anything else.”","[{'summary_text': '""from the moment I started working for her, she became like a second family to me,"" one student nominator said .

Ken Foster announced as the 2023 Hovde Award recipient,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The 2023 Frederick L. Hovde Award of Excellence in Educational Service, made possible through the support of Indiana Farm Bureau Inc., was presented to Ken Foster, professor of agricultural economics, on Dec. 15, celebrating his leadership, which has left an exceptional impact on rural communities across the state.
Inspired by his own professors’ and mentors’ outreach and experience in the Peace Corps, the Purdue alumnus came back to the College of Agriculture as a professor to focus on teaching, research and outreach activities. During his 33-year career, Foster has made an impact on Indiana farmers and beyond through leading the establishment of the Center for Commercial Agriculture and serving as executive director of the Purdue Farm Policy Study Group. He also secured seed funding to launch the Food Entrepreneurship and Manufacturing Institute (FEMI), supporting the rural Indiana economy and emerging food entrepreneurs.
Bernie Engel, the Glenn W. Sample Dean of Agriculture, praised Foster for his long history of outreach to Indiana’s rural communities.
“From his early work educating pork producers on contract production challenges to his leadership in establishing the Center for Commercial Agriculture to bring advanced farm management information to farmers, Ken has had a profound impact,” Engel said. “His deep dedication to the College of Agriculture and its land-grant mission makes him an ideal recipient of the Hovde Award.”
After Karen Plaut, former College of Agriculture dean, was appointed to the role of executive vice president for research for the university in January 2023, she asked Foster to serve as interim dean of the college.
“What sets Ken apart is his selflessness and willingness to step outside his comfort zone for the greater good. Ken served as department head for both Agricultural Economics and Food Science previously and, on short notice, stepped up as interim dean,” Plaut said. “He has always worked tirelessly on behalf of the college to keep the commitment to the land-grant mission front and center.”
Foster said receiving the award has been a humbling experience, thanking those who paved the way and inspired him.
“Purdue has done a lot for me as a student and throughout my career, and the people of Indiana supported a scholarship that made it possible for me to go to college,” he said. “Receiving the Hovde Award and knowing what it stands for is extremely rewarding because it means that I was able to repay a debt that I owe to Purdue, Indiana Farm Bureau and the people of Indiana.”","[{'summary_text': 'the 2023 Frederick L.

Jonathan Wilker is a Purdue University professor of chemistry in the College of Science and of materials engineering. In this video, he explains why cardboard boxes covered in tape make recycling difficult and how sustainable alternatives could make things better — both for consumers and the environment. The holiday season is one of the busiest times of year for sending and receiving packages. Wilker says adhesives like tape and glue are in everything from furniture, electronics, packaging and shoes. Unfortunately, current petroleum-based adhesives are not recyclable and take a long time to break down once thrown away. This also makes recycling cardboard boxes difficult, as they are often covered in tape that is hard to remove. Wilker’s lab is working to create new adhesives that are sustainably sourced, potentially carbon negative and low cost. His team hopes that new sustainable adhesives can make recycling easier and reduce environmental damage.

Plant metabolism proves more complicated than previously understood,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Plants have evolved fiendishly complicated metabolic networks. For years, scientists focused on how plants make secondary metabolites, the compounds that plants produce to enhance their defense and survival mechanisms.
“Only recently we started appreciating that the genes involved in making those specialized, secondary metabolites are being regulated,” said Ying Li, associate professor of horticulture and landscape architecture at Purdue University. “They are turned on when plants need to make secondary metabolites. And they are turned off when plants will no longer need to make them.”
Purdue’s Natalia Dudareva, Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry and Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, said, “Also, secondary metabolites are often toxic to cells when they accumulate to high levels, as we saw when we manipulated the resistance of the barriers that volatile secondary metabolites have to pass through to be released into the atmosphere. However, cells sense the accumulation of these toxic compounds and downregulate genes responsible for the formation of precursors for these volatiles.”
In a special issue of the journal Trends in Plant Science, Li and Dudavera highlight the importance of specialized metabolites in regulating the genes that plants use to form chemical compounds. Dudareva directs and Li is a member of Purdue’s Center for Plant Biology, which aims to provide a clearer understanding of processes that affect plant biology.
“We saw initial hints that the secondary metabolites themselves can be the signal to say, ‘OK, now we need to turn those genes on and off,’” Li said. “And we almost know nothing about how metabolites are sensed by the plants and then lead to the genes turning on and off.”
Sorting out the complexities of secondary metabolism presents challenges because the process is highly specific to each different plant lineage. Sometimes only specific cells make secondary metabolites at a certain time for a given plant type. And the plants often produce metabolites in small quantities, making them difficult to detect.
Researchers also need to assay how the metabolites interact with proteins. “That allows you to say which protein can sense and bind to these metabolites,” Li said. Gene regulation is also involved. “You have to be able to assay gene expression. And that is enabled by the next-generation sequencing toolkit.”
Even though a specific plant makes its own unique metabolites, “next-gene sequencing in the last 20 years allows us to look at the genome activity of any plants,” she said.
Like many plant scientists, Li focused much of her research on primary metabolism, especially nitrogen metabolism, which plants rely upon for growth. The level of specialization in secondary metabolism surprised her. Despite the differences between primary and secondary metabolism, they seem to follow similar rules at the molecular level, she said.
“Secondary metabolites are important for a plant to adapt to a stressful situation. For example, during drought or pathogen attack, secondary metabolites help to fight off those stresses,” Li said. Secondary metabolism is also important for pollination success. Flowers attract insects, but climate change brings concerns about whether the pollinator-plant relationship can keep working.
“For these reasons, there is always a dream of being able to do metabolic engineering to make plants produce more of the specialized metabolites that are good for plant survival, better resistance to a stress condition, to make medicine, or attract pollinators better,” she said.
Researchers need to better understand how producing too many metabolites can upset gene regulation. But if the process can be disrupted in the right place, “then we can safely produce a lot of metabolites because it doesn’t trigger the feedback regulation,” Li said.
Michigan State University’s Erich Grotewold also contributed to the Trends in Plant Science article.

Fueling advanced manufacturing growth across Indiana’s Hard-Tech Corridor: Reimagine IN-MaC through Purdue in West Lafayette and Indianapolis,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
To fuel and impact the ongoing manufacturing renaissance and expand its reach across Indiana, Purdue University is launching the Indiana Next-Generation Manufacturing Competitiveness Center (IN-MaC) node at Purdue University in Indianapolis in a joint venture with Purdue’s Manufacturing and Materials Research Laboratories.
Since its inception, IN-MaC has been a partnership between the Purdue Polytechnic Institute and the College of Engineering and includes collaboration with Ivy Tech and Vincennes University to help solve manufacturing challenges for Indiana-based companies. Recently, Purdue leadership advocated for a Hard-Tech Corridor between West Lafayette and Indianapolis as a way to support Indiana manufacturing, entrepreneurship and economic development in critical technology areas. To support this initiative, IN-MaC will be reimagined in a way that will now have two locations — West Lafayette and Indianapolis — to amplify digital, physical and sustainable industrial transformation impact along the corridor.

"Graduating Purdue senior channels entrepreneurial mindset to propel growth, success in her hometown","summarize:In the backyard of her grandparents’ home in Gary, Indiana, a young Emmani Ellis’ mind races as she tinkers with discarded gutters, wood scraps and other remnants of her family’s past real estate projects. She uses her imagination as a guide to transform the broken pieces into creative solutions like seesaws and irrigation systems. To some, the items are clutter, but to Ellis, they’re a playground for her entrepreneurial mind and spirit — a starting point for the years of innovation that would soon follow.
Before she was a Purdue senior double-majoring in mechatronics engineering technology and robotics engineering technology in the Purdue Polytechnic Institute, Ellis was a high school student using money generated from her mobile device repair business — Ramani Repair — to fuel up the car she’d just received a license to drive. Her peers would hand over their broken laptops, cellphones, tablets and other electronics to Ellis at school, and she’d mend them after school or during homeroom, taking pride in her affordable, accessible and self-taught woman-led business.
Now gearing up to walk across the stage during Purdue’s Winter 2023 Commencement ceremonies, Ellis is brimming with excitement for the possibilities that lie ahead. But her future isn’t the only thing on her mind. Ellis is dreaming up ways she can use her Purdue degrees and entrepreneurship certificate to enrich her hometown of Gary and the lives of those in it through the collective efforts of her two companies — IronWorkz and No Limit Living.
“Growing up, I’ve had such a great support system, but I’ve watched people near me not succeed as well as I have,” Ellis says. “My peers aren’t less than me; they just had less access than me. I want to be a part of the difference. I want to help people take their next step in life. I recognized that I am so fortunate, and I am passionate about wanting this fortune for other people.”
Founded in January by Ellis, Purdue Northwest student Alex Termini and Purdue alumna Faith Spencer, IronWorkz is a business incubator that strives to support and stabilize entrepreneurship and youth success in northwest Indiana. The name references Gary’s years as a booming steel city full of opportunity and growth — a reminder of the past that empowers the trio to build a better future.
By hosting workshops; speaker series; and other local gatherings focusing on financial literacy, mindset and mental health, and community engagement, Ellis and her IronWorkz team aim to become a driver of economic development, entrepreneurship and growth in the city they all hail from. During its first full summer of programming, IronWorkz hosted six workshops, reaching over 200 individuals in the community. Bounce houses, inflatable ax-throwing, and food and business vendors took center stage at the organization’s back-to-school bash, where IronWorkz used its funding to hand out a choice of $25 school uniform vouchers or backpacks to more than 100 local students.
“So many people in Gary have been desperately waiting for something like this to come, but few in my generation have been willing to take that step,” Ellis says. “Most who believe in the city are older, and it’s kind of revolutionary for our community that we’re young and ready to give back. We see ourselves as being part of the catalyst for the revitalization of Gary.”
For now, the team plans to foster connections with local leaders, organizations and community members by hosting pop-up events, but Ellis and her peers have big goals on the horizon. They plan to find space in the city to create a co-working site for aspiring entrepreneurs and leaders, a venue that individuals and groups can rent out for events, and a roller rink where community members of all ages can gather and enjoy.
There is currently a lack of these spaces in Gary, but that won’t stop IronWorkz from using its ever-growing resources to confidently carry out its mission and inch closer to the prosperous future its founders envision for the city.
“We see businesses coming back,” Ellis says. “We see Broadway full of lively businesses, coffee shops and places where people can meet up, entertain themselves and grab something to eat. We see beautiful homes and new apartment complexes replacing dilapidated housing. We see the city flourishing, looking lively and being economically stable.”
That vision is one step closer to reality thanks to Ellis’ own nonprofit venture, No Limit Living, a real estate investment firm dedicated to acquiring, rehabilitating and selling housing properties in Gary. While she strives to change the visual narrative and drive homeownership and economic stability in her hometown, Ellis also yearns to use funds generated by the venture to support mentorship programs for underserved communities in northwest Indiana.
After successfully flipping her first home in the fall of 2022, Ellis doubled down, eager to show others in the community that there are no limits to leading a better life. As she waits to begin gutting and rehabilitating several local abandoned properties, she’s refining her organization’s latest offering — real estate drone photography. And thanks to the innovation and expertise of undergraduate students in The Data Mine, Purdue’s learning community for students preparing for a data-driven workforce, Ellis, who participated as a corporate partner this year, will soon launch a brand-new website for the venture.
Ellis says Purdue has played a key role in her success. It’s where she fine-tuned her leadership abilities and entrepreneurial mindset, giving way to a nomination for TechPoint’s 2023 Student Entrepreneur of the Year Award and accolades like the 2023 Black Engineer of the Year Student Leadership Award. It’s where she fostered invaluable connections that opened doors for her future. And it’s where she found the confidence to pursue her passion.
“My network of people is astronomical because I have attended this university,” Ellis says. “I know how to communicate better, and I am very analytical with my engineering degrees. Overall, I am very well-rounded and very well-connected, but I think one of the biggest ways that Purdue has helped is that it’s allowed me to connect with some awesome people and has given me the confidence to do so.”
Confidence isn’t Ellis’ sole driver; it’s paired with the effects she’s already witnessing from her efforts. After accepting her diploma in Purdue’s Elliott Hall of Music, she’ll return home, ready to get to work.
“It’s been empowering to be a beacon of hope in my community,” Ellis says. “I feel like I’m actually called to the impact work that I’m doing, and if I’m going to do that, now is the time. I’m just excited for the radical growth that’s about to happen in Gary; I can feel it coming.”","[{'summary_text': 'ironWorkz is a business incubator that aims to support and stabilize entrepreneurship and youth success in northwest Indiana . the team plans to create a co-working site for aspiring entrepreneurs and leaders, a venue that individuals and groups can rent out for events, and a roller rink .'}]"

Purdue Global advances in Military Times’ 2023 Best for Vets rankings
Crystal Johnson, Ryon Kumrow and Sonora Vasquez share stories of their time in the U.S. military and how they look to the future thanks to Purdue Global’s commitment to veterans and active-duty personnel.
In addition to interviews with Johnson, Kumrow and Vasquez, the episode includes comments from Dooley and Kelvin Gumbs, executive director for educational partnerships with Purdue’s Office of Industry Partnerships. Gumbs is also a Purdue Global graduate and Navy veteran.
Johnson of South Carolina is an Army veteran who served as a supply specialist and recently received her bachelor’s degree in health care administration. On the show, she talks about her journey to Purdue Global and how that could help her as a working adult and mother, especially as she is currently working on her master’s degree.
Kumrow of Virginia serves in the Navy as a hospital corpsman. He received his bachelor’s degree in health care administration and is still actively serving. Kumrow was part of a crucial 2020 COVID-19 humanitarian relief mission in South Texas.
Vasquez is Purdue Global’s on-site director for its extension office at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. She served in the Air Force and Space Force for over 24 years.
“One reason why Purdue Global is such a strong opportunity for active service members is we have a program where … we match the training that one would get as they progress through their levels of specialization with our degree programs. We’ve taken their training and stood it right next to an associate degree, and we fill in the gaps. It’s a beautiful program,” Dooley said.
Ultimately a service member will be able to build a career path they can embark on following their service.
Purdue Global serves about 10,000 military-affiliated students, including uniformed personnel, veterans and eligible dependents. Purdue Global also has 133 veterans who are faculty or staff members.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey. Purdue Global is a nonprofit, public university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and backed by Purdue University. For more information, visit https://stories.purdue.edu/purdue-global/.

Staff Excellence: Purdue University Police Department,"summarize:At Purdue University, the pursuit of excellence at scale is a collective endeavor that relies heavily on the efforts of its dedicated and talented staff. From supporting faculty in their groundbreaking research to fostering student success to ensuring the seamless operation of the university’s many functions, staff members play a pivotal role across campus.
Purdue Today is recognizing these efforts with its “Staff Excellence” series, which today focuses on the Purdue University Police Department.
35,721. That is how many calls for service the Purdue University Police Department has received so far in 2023. That number has already surpassed 2022’s total of 33,601.
“Purdue has seen an increase in enrollment, and our department has new ways to report bicycle thefts, which may be reflected in our department’s numbers. There are more people on campus needing help with a variety of issues, including theft, vehicle unlocks and traffic assistance,” says PUPD Chief Lesley Wiete. “Not only have our calls for service increased, our case numbers and traffic stops have also increased.”
Dispatchers and officers who respond to many of these calls make up the patrol division. This division is the largest one within the department and includes four different day and night shifts. Wiete says that while dispatchers and officers are often on the front lines of the department, it takes several divisions and individuals to operate a police department.
Administrative Services works more behind the scenes. It includes the training division, investigations division and special-event security operations. Administrative Services also oversees the Commission for Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) reaccreditation program. The program requires PUPD to comply with standards that provide guidance and best practices related to police procedures.
Special Services includes records, IT, the fleet, equipment and uniform inventory. This division also oversees the Student Security Patrol program, a group of students who assist the department and provide the Safe Walk Program.
More outward-facing are the outreach programs offered by PUPD. Some of these programs include verbal de-escalation training, Civilian Response to Active Shooter Events training and K-9 demonstrations.
“Each of these divisions plays a vital role in the collective success of the department,” Wiete says. “I am grateful to have such dedicated, hard-working individuals as part of my team. They deserve to be recognized for the excellence they demonstrate every day to keep our campus safe and secure.”
Wiete says to help keep the department accountable, PUPD complies with the Clery Act, which ensures people are properly informed about campus crimes. PUPD has a daily crime log, which documents all crimes reported to the department.
“It’s important that we, as a police department, continue to put our best efforts forward, hold ourselves accountable and achieve the standards set by the CALEA reaccreditation — all while meeting the needs of the campus community in a reliable and timely manner,” Wiete says.
The community can also keep up with the department through PUPD’s recently refreshed X/Twitter account. Follow @Purdue_Police for the latest updates and information from the department.
PUPD is part of the Administrative Operations organization, which supports the university by providing safe, reliable and transformative services. Recognizing and highlighting the excellent standards met by the men and women of the police department is just one of the ways the organization helps power Purdue.","[{'summary_text': ""PUPD has received 35,721 calls for service so far in 2023 . that number has already surpassed 2022's total of 33,601.""}]"

Advanced practice registered nurses adapt to expanded telehealth use during and after pandemic,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
During the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing staff leaders scrambled to find online platforms that would allow providers to treat patients via telehealth.
A new paper published in The Nurse Practitioner looks at how 75 advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) across Illinois not only adapted to telehealth but also found ways to expand its use in their nursing practices to this day.
Purdue Global unveils new simulation center and growing partnership with CHI Health
Manning Regional Healthcare Center joins educational alliance with Purdue Global
Purdue Global School of Nursing honors four students with DAISY Awards
The research was conducted by Deborah Adelman, a professor of graduate nursing at Purdue Global; Catherine Fant, an adjunct graduate nursing faculty member at Walden University; and Julia Koklys, an assistant professor in graduate nursing at Lewis University.
The group explored how APRNs responded to the need to abruptly switch from in-person to telehealth options because of the pandemic, especially as most other studies examined this phenomenon from the perspective of patients, physicians and physician assistants, Adelman said. The researchers found that while many APRNs recognized the benefits of telehealth visits, some concerns remain regarding the equity of internet access, patient computer and technology literacy, and quality of care.
For the study’s purposes, APRNs included nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse midwives and certified registered nurse anesthetists.
According to Adelman, most of the APRNs were comfortable with the concept of using telehealth despite issues regarding technology and platform performance and were optimistic about its impact on patient care.
“We noticed those in the rural areas were more comfortable with it, and it was a patient satisfier,” Adelman said. “APRNs were already comfortable in using technology to send tests to larger urban medical centers for results. The pandemic made it more routine with time because they had to use it.”
In addition to overcoming tech issues, nurse practitioners had to adjust to how care was delivered to patients online, as well as to new routines and the additional training needed to fully utilize the technology.
“They are now seeing patients who would have hesitated to come into a medical office,” Adelman said. “There’s an awakening to the fact there is an inequity to internet access, as well as what is happening off camera or behind the scenes and patient privacy issues.”
Illinois, like many other states, is increasing broadband access, which could in turn increase residents’ telehealth use.
The research showed that most participants were able to develop or maintain rapport with new or established patients using telehealth and felt that their patients were satisfied by these virtual visits. Adelman said that while some participants surveyed felt that patients received somewhat worse care than new or existing patients seen in person, she believes those issues could be caused by other patient factors such as poor vision or hearing, or technology issues for both patients and providers. Even if they felt their patients experienced these kinds of issues, APRNs overall wanted to continue using telehealth platforms in the future, and new federal legislation has allowed for that to happen post-pandemic.
Adelman said having APRNs excited to use and expand the use of telehealth is a good thing, especially as a way to reach more people and address health disparities. She is concerned how some hospitals and clinics are starting to charge additional fees for telehealth use and basic services that would be free or at a minimal cost to some patients in an office setting.
“This is a permanent part of the future of health care delivery, as it could help with the provider shortage,” Adelman said. “However, I am concerned that we may be moving too fast, and we should move more deliberately with use and policies.”
Adelman would like to replicate the study, particularly in another state with a more dispersed population, as she believes medical providers and populations in such areas are more comfortable using telehealth at a higher rate due to distance. She would also like to look at how nurse educators are using online platforms for activities like patient education and provider training. Another area needing more research is the length of a virtual appointment.
“This study gave a voice to nurse practitioners. There are all types of areas that we have to think about now, especially as we have so much data and comments to review,” Adelman said.
Funding for the study was provided by Epsilon Upsilon Sigma chapter. Additional support was provided by the American Nurses Association-Illinois and the Illinois Society for Advanced Practice Nursing, which distributed information about the study to Illinois-based APRNs.

Are electric VTOL aircraft the future of urban mobility? It all depends on the batteries,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The future of transportation may be above us, with electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles. These aircraft combine the speed and convenience of helicopters with the electric power of drones — and the potential of sustainable carbon-free aviation. But achieving this future requires scrutiny of the vehicle’s most important component: the batteries. Purdue University researchers have conducted one of the first lithium-ion battery investigations specific to the demands of eVTOL vehicles.

USDA determines Insignum AgTech corn plants can be sold and grown without restriction,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A ruling by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service allows farmers and growers to run trials on corn plants developed by Insignum AgTech. These plants use naturally occurring pigment to signal when specific plant stresses begin.
Insignum AgTech CEO Kyle Mohler said the plant turns purple to indicate that a fungal infection has started but is not yet apparent.
Mohler, who earned his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Purdue University’s College of Agriculture, founded Insignum AgTech in 2019.
A Nov. 14 news release from the USDA stated, “The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) recently reviewed 12 plants modified using genetic engineering to determine whether they posed an increased plant pest risk as relative to non-modified comparators. …
“APHIS found these modified plants were unlikely to pose an increased plant pest risk compared to other cultivated plants. As a result, they are not subject to regulation under 7 CFR part 340. From a plant pest risk perspective, these modified plants may be safely grown and bred in the United States.”
Mohler said the announcement represents a milestone for Insignum AgTech and its customers.
“It means our edited plants can be grown and tested across the U.S. without restrictive permits, opening the door for our customers to run trials,” Mohler said. “It strengthens our ability to help farmers treat specific problems affecting their crops exactly when, precisely where and only if needed to sustainably increase crop production.”
Mohler said the company will develop additional plant traits that utilize other natural pigments, like red or blue, to give an early indication of yield-limiting factors such as insect pests or fertility loss.
“Farmers will gain the ability to sustainably and precisely treat when and where needed, ultimately increasing yields without arbitrarily increasing costly inputs,” Mohler said.
In April 2023, Insignum AgTech and Beck’s signed an agreement to test Insignum’s corn traits in Beck’s elite varieties. In January 2022, Insignum AgTech received a $100,000 investment from the Purdue Ag-Celerator, an agriculture innovation fund operated by the Purdue Foundry, with assistance from the Purdue College of Agriculture, the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization and the agricultural industry. Foundry and OTC are now part of the Purdue Innovates network.
Insignum AgTech creates biotechnology that enables plants to use their pigments to warn growers about plant stresses, such as disease, insect pests or low fertility. For more information, see www.insignum.ag.
Purdue Innovates is a unified network at Purdue Research Foundation to assist Purdue faculty, staff, students and alumni in either IP commercialization or startup creation. As a conduit to technology commercialization, intellectual property protection and licensing, startup creation, and venture capital, Purdue Innovates serves as the front door to translate new ideas into world-changing impact.

National policy aimed at reducing U.S. greenhouse gases also would improve water quality,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A climate policy that raises the price of carbon-intensive products across the entire U.S. economy would yield a side benefit of reducing nitrate groundwater contamination throughout the Mississippi River Basin.
The Gulf of Mexico, an important U.S. fishery, also would see modest benefits from the nitrate reductions. These were among the conclusions of a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
The study, led by four early career researchers, three of them from Purdue University, combined four scientific models to simulate how different aspects of climate policy, agricultural economics and the environment would interact. A major feature of the study traced how nitrogen that humans have converted into other forms, called reactive nitrogen, flows through the environment.
“Food production is generating a lot of the reactive nitrogen. Some comes from energy as well,” said study co-author Thomas Hertel, Distinguished Professor of Agricultural Economics at Purdue. “This is a big problem. The reactive nitrogen ends up in rural groundwater. Some of it ends up in the atmosphere. And of course, it ends up in the streams and eventually the Gulf of Mexico.”
Excessive fertilizer use creates a growing number of water-quality concerns, said Shan Zuidema, a research scientist at the University of New Hampshire’s Earth Systems Research Center. “Our models showed that with this climate policy, U.S. carbon emissions could significantly decline, which would translate into about a 3% to 4% reduction of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone in an average year.”
One of the study’s four linked models analyzed various issues related to climate change economics. Another model linked local policies to national and international agriculture prices, land use and the environment. A third produced an estimate of nitrate leaching in the entire Mississippi River Basin based on changes in fertilization rates and land cover. The fourth simulated vertical water exchange between the ground and atmosphere and horizontal transport through runoff and stream networks.
Central to the study was the “nitrogen cascade” concept that the University of Virginia’s James Galloway and his co-authors published in 2003. The concept states that a single nitrogen atom may trigger a cascade of effects in the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater and marine systems, and on human health.
The PNAS study documented how much nitrogen gets harvested with the remainder getting put into the environment.
Galloway, UVA’s Sidman P. Poole Professor Emeritus of Environmental Sciences, who was not a co-author of the PNAS study, noted that for more than 100 years, an abundant supply of nitrogen has fueled agricultural production.
“Tracking these nitrogen losses, and trying to mitigate them, requires an approach that links economics, agroecology and hydrology to ensure that actions at one point in the chain do not have unintended consequences at another point.” The PNAS paper “is an excellent example of the type of work that is needed,” Galloway said.
The study included an assessment of policy outcomes that assigned the social cost of carbon to estimates ranging from $51 to $152 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalents.
“Fertilizer is most affected because ammonia fertilizer is largely converted natural gas,” Hertel said. The highest carbon price in the models reduced U.S. carbon emission by almost 50%. Coupled with an increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices, this reduced fertilizer applications by about 15% for corn production across the Mississippi River Basin.
The team also considered a scenario that restored wetlands in the central U.S. Corn Belt without a climate policy. The farmers in the area grew less corn and applied less fertilizer. But that prompted increased fertilizer applications in the untreated regions, resulting in negative spillover.
“It seems like every environmental policy we look at has spillovers. They haven’t been considered before, but when you think about the economics and what we call market-mediated spillovers, they’re pervasive,” said Hertel, who founded and is executive director of Purdue’s Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). Hertel and co-authors include a discussion of spillovers in a recent special issue of Environmental Research Letters that focuses on global-to-local-to-global sustainability analysis challenges.
The PNAS study looked only at carbon pricing and wetlands, but many other food system interventions lend themselves to similar analyses, including how a change in our diets could affect the nitrogen cascade. “How about reducing food waste, or reducing ethanol production? Or improving nitrogen use efficiency?” Hertel asked.
In addition to Hertel, the Purdue co-authors are: Jing Liu, research economist in agricultural economics; Maksym Chepeliev, principal research economist at GTAP; David Johnson, associate professor of industrial engineering and political science; and Uris Baldos, research associate professor of agricultural economics.","[{'summary_text': 'a recent study simulated how different aspects of climate policy, agricultural economics and the environment would interact . the study traced how nitrogen that humans have converted into other forms flows through the environment . a single nitrogen atom may trigger a cascade of effects in the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater and marine systems .'}]"

Daniels’ Purdue legacy honored at bust unveiling ceremony,"summarize:President Emeritus Mitchell E.Daniels, Jr. knew of Purdue University’s tradition to honor its former presidents with a bust sculpture, joining the storied lineup of the Boilermaker leaders who went before him.
And the self-deprecating Daniels suggested he knew the ideal spot to display his commemorative bust in the Purdue Memorial Union instead of the Great Hall: “There’s a broom closest on the third floor and it’s just the right size,” he remarked.
But Purdue’s 12th president also was clearly moved by the outpouring he received at the special celebration in his honor Friday.
“It’s incredibly gratifying not only because of all of you who are here, but the spectrum of those of you here in the audience — from the Purdue community, my co-workers and those from my previous lives, too,” an emotional Daniels said during the event. “That’s probably the greatest gift you could have given me. It means a lot.”
At the event, Mike Berghoff, chair of the university’s Board of Trustees, recounted what led to Daniels’ selection during the summer of 2012 and his arrival on campus Jan. 1, 2013. And Berghoff shared some of the many highlights of what would become the Daniels Decade and the contributions he made during his time at the helm of this land-grant university.
Unprecedented enrollment growth. Changing how learning and research are delivered across campus. New highs in fundraising through the Ever True campaign. Expanding the university’s land-grant mission through the creation of Purdue Global and Purdue Polytechnic High Schools. Spearheading over $500 million in facility improvement projects. And championing university-led economic development through major efforts such as Discovery Park District at Purdue.
“Mitch Daniels totally transformed the trajectory of this place,” Berghoff said. “I know you have high expectations of yourself, Mitch. But you delivered. You really delivered. You allowed hundreds of thousands of Boilermakers to stoke the flame they have for achieving their dreams and pursuing an education at the nation’s most consequential university.
“You reminded us often that anything’s possible with a Purdue education. And our responsibility as trustees, as stewards of this great university, is to make sure the momentum you created during the Daniels Decade continues.”
Purdue President Mung Chiang noted the poignancy of the  day’s celebration by summarizing what the trustees had just approved during their morning meeting in Stewart Center — a plan to extend for a 13th year, through 2025-26, a tuition freeze first implemented by Daniels while enabling the $1.3 billion and counting worth of investment in new facilities; elevation of research capabilities that led to the winning of 3 national hubs; and economic development at Discovery Park District that led to the long-awaited resumption of commercial air service at Purdue University Airport.
“There is no other university leader like Mitch Daniels. Our university hit all-time records in student access and success, in research and innovation, and in transformative growth,” Chiang said. “Thank you, Mitch, for elevating the most consequential university in America.”
Chiang also spoke about the significance of the presidential busts at Purdue and the tradition of having them on display in the Memorial Union Great Hall. And he reminded the audience what an honor it is to succeed Daniels as Purdue’s 13th president, thanking him for his impactful 10 years of leadership and what he will forever mean to Boilermakers everywhere.
“If I were to list all of the accomplishments and the impact of the Daniels Decade, it would be thicker than this book of the wise counsel that Mitch has given us over the past 10 years,” said Chiang, holding up a copy of Daniels’ new book, “Boiler Up: A University President in the Public Square.” “Words and ideas matter, and no one can articulate ideas better than our very own Mitch Daniels.”
Following the ceremony, attendees had the opportunity to purchase the book. Proceeds from book sales support the scholarship fund at Purdue Polytechnic High Schools.
The bronze bust of Daniels was sculpted by artist Jon Hair, who also was commissioned to create the bronze Purdue Boilermaker statue just outside Ross-Ade Stadium.
“Boiler Up: A University President in the Public Square” offers readers a fascinating compendium of commencement addresses, published columns, and transcripts of speeches and hosted events spanning 10 years of insights and insightful interactions that put Daniels front and center among American thought leaders.
Throughout the book, Daniels’ sharp intellect, incisive analysis and delightful sense of humor reign supreme. Via embedded QR codes, readers can “attend” recorded content, including evenings with Condoleezza Rice, Garry Kasparov, Walter Isaacson and other fascinating people. Whether the reader seeks lessons on leadership or immersion in engaging ideas, “Boiler Up” is a tour de force of transformative thinking.","[{'summary_text': '""there is no other university leader like Mitch Daniels,"" says purdue president .

Star of wonder: Dazzling new image of supernova Cassiopeia A released by First Lady Jill Biden and Purdue astronomer,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Ten thousand years ago, a star exploded. Now scientists are getting their best look ever at the details of that explosion, Cassiopeia A. Space-age tools and methods are allowing them to glimpse never-seen-before details that may change forever the way scientists think about star death, star formation and the distribution of matter in the galaxy. And now, a new image of that dead star has a starring role in First Lady Jill Biden’s digital Advent calendar this year.
The James Webb Space Telescope hosts an array of tools that includes the NIRCam, a telescope that looks at light in the near-infrared wavelengths. Astronomers use NIRCam observations to map out matter in those wavelengths and assign colors to make previously unseen features visible.
Dan Milisavljevic is an astronomer and an expert on star explosions. An associate professor of physics and astronomy in Purdue University’s College of Science, Milisavljevic (pronounced mili-sahv-la-vich) leads the project team whose data contributed to the staggeringly detailed new image.
“We’ve never had this kind of look at an exploded star before,” Milisavljevic said. “Supernovae are primary drivers of cosmological evolution. The energies, their chemical abundances — there is so much that depends on our understanding of supernovae. This is the closest look we’ve had at a supernova in our galaxy.

Milisavljevic leads a team of nearly 40 scientists and researchers from more than 30 institutions — including Harvard, Princeton and Johns Hopkins universities, as well as Los Alamos National Laboratory and the SETI Institute — in studying Cassiopeia A, one of the more puzzling objects in the galaxy. Cassiopeia A comprises the remnants of a supernova explosion and has at its heart a neutron star that doesn’t behave the way scientists think neutron stars ought to behave.
“It’s staggering,” Milisavljevic said. “Some features have popped up that are completely new — that will change the way we think about stellar life cycles. And other features that have been studied disappear in the new NIRcam image. Why? And what does that mean for our understanding of how stars form and die?”
Before the James Webb Space Telescope started studying the heavens in 2022, the Hubble Space Telescope allowed humans to see farther into space and deeper into time. The James Webb Space Telescope is bigger, more complex and orbits farther from the Earth than Hubble, allowing it unprecedented opportunities for interstellar sleuthing. The James Webb Space Telescope looks even farther into space and time and with an unprecedented range of wavelengths and strength of definition. The knowledge it uncovers may help scientists take the next small steps out into the universe — and discern where humans want to go next and why.
“The images don’t just look better — they’re different,” Milisavljevic said. “It’s not just higher resolution, but the James Webb Space Telescope is looking at infrared emissions sensitive to a variety of different elements and molecules that Hubble cannot access. It’s exciting to look at the promise of the James Webb Space Telescope coming true.”

Purdue Global Law School launches AI course,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue Global Law School has introduced a new course to address the evolving artificial intelligence landscape and the challenges and opportunities it presents for society and the law.
The new course, CL810 — Artificial Intelligence Law, was designed to help students understand AI’s legal impact, particularly in the areas of intellectual property, privacy and regulation of the technology itself.
“Law schools should be preparing students not just for the world as it exists today but also for how it is likely to exist in the future,” said Martin Pritkin, dean of the law school. “Purdue Global Law School, which has technological innovation woven into its DNA as the nation’s first fully online law school, seeks to be ahead of the curve in addressing the impact of game-changing AI.”

The course, which will be taught by Shaun Jamison, associate dean for academic affairs, will feature 15 modules that touch on topics such as ethics and governance, plagiarism, AI and criminal justice, and the future of AI and the law.
“One of the best ways that students learn is through critique and self-reflection,” said Jamison, who created the course with Pritikin. “AI can help by creating an essay answer or an arbitration decision based on a fact scenario, and the student can then critique it. For the reflection part, a student could also run some of their work through AI for critique and feedback in addition to the feedback they get from the professor. We’re also investigating using AI for client interviewing simulations.”
Regarding concerns about the dangers of AI when it comes to practicing law, Jamison believes the benefits outweigh the risks but says it’s important to keep a healthy balance of AI and human interaction.
“We need to consider the possibility of bias in AI or even where it may not perform as well as we expect,” Jamison said. “That’s why it’s important to have human oversight and quality control of AI. When you use an AI tool, do you know what steps were taken to avoid bias? What data was used? This is important in the law because the law evolves. If we train AI based on discriminatory applications of the law, then the AI will be influenced by this and perpetuate past wrongs.”
Pritikin said, “AI does, or soon will, affect virtually every aspect of our society and our economy — and so does the law. Law students and others need to understand how these two critical fields intersect so that they can better navigate the changing legal profession or whatever field they may be in.”
Students can begin signing up now through the school’s academic catalog for the course, which begins Jan. 3 at the start of the next term. The course is an elective in which students will earn three credits upon completion.

European technology leader imec opens innovation hub at Purdue,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University and Belgium-based technological innovation organization imec on Friday (Dec. 8) celebrated the grand opening of a research and development hub at the Convergence Center for Innovation and Collaboration on Purdue’s campus. The presence of imec at Purdue will help facilitate groundbreaking advancements in semiconductor technologies.
To mark the occasion, Purdue President Mung Chiang was joined by Luc Van den hove, president and CEO of imec, and Jan Jambon, minister-president of Flanders, the Flemish region of Belgium, following their visit with the Indiana Economic Development Corporation and Gov. Eric Holcomb in Indianapolis.
“Purdue University is excited to open the joint center with imec and IEDC on our campus after the ribbon-cutting ceremony today with Minister-President Jambon and CEO Van den hove,” Chiang said. “Purdue is established as a leading university in semiconductors through successes such as the Department of Defense Microelectronic Commons Hub, SCALE workforce consortium, U.S.-Japan semiconductor alliance, U.S.-India semiconductor partnership and more. This partnership with imec, the crown jewel of chips innovation in Europe, will flourish as a strategically pivotal moment in the growing ecosystem of semiconductors in the heart of the Silicon Heartland. It also builds a bridge between our university and universities and companies in Flanders, in Belgium and in Europe.”

The Purdue location represents imec’s first Midwest research office, adding to its offices in California and Florida.
With imec and IEDC’s investment, researchers from the global R&D technology company will work side by side with faculty and students at the Birck Nanotechnology Center, located in Discovery Park District at Purdue. Similarly, students and faculty will have an opportunity to work in Belgium.
The partnership is the result of an unprecedented collaboration announced in May among imec, the IEDC and the university.
“Working together, we can leverage each other’s capabilities and enhance the quality and pace of innovation to improve technological outcomes more than we could independently,” said Mark Lundstrom, Purdue’s chief semiconductor officer and senior advisor to the president. “The collaboration aims to capitalize on imec’s extensive global expertise and Purdue’s academic prowess to further propel Indiana into a prominent position within the semiconductor innovation ecosystem.”
The Convergence Center, which is already a hub for interdisciplinary research and collaboration, will now house imec staff, who, in collaboration with Purdue researchers, will aim to push the boundaries of nano- and digital technology innovations. The trans-Atlantic partnership is poised to elevate Indiana’s status in the semiconductor industry by fostering collaborative research and development initiatives among academia, industry and economic development partners.
“The state is a strong supporter of this partnership because of the strong potential for economic development benefits,” said Lundstrom, who was named in April to lead Purdue’s semiconductor task force. “A significant imec presence will help draw other companies here that already partner with imec in Europe and now can collaborate with imec on Purdue’s campus.”
The collaboration aligns with Purdue’s commitment to academic excellence, positions the university at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies and further underscores the multifaceted approach to solidify its position as the heart of the Silicon Heartland.
The addition of the imec location is the latest in an ever-expanding list of global partnerships and initiatives that Purdue has forged to build the collaborative network that will define the future of semiconductor, nanoelectronics and digital technologies R&D at Purdue.
Purdue’s growing semiconductor innovation ecosystem is one of three key pillars of Purdue Computes, a comprehensive initiative across computing departments, physical AI, semiconductors and quantum to enable unparalleled excellence at scale.

University raises stipend minimum again for PhD students,"summarize:Dear Purdue graduate students,
We write to provide you an update on our continued efforts to support and invest in your education and efforts to drive our university forward. In the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Scholars, not only do daily support functions continue, but new programs and additional resources are also deployed.
Beginning with Fall semester, on August 12, 2024, the new minimum stipend will increase to $28,000 for FY appointments.
As this universitywide minimum applies to both TAs and RAs, a university fund will be available for faculty whose current funded projects do not permit rebudgeting to apply for potential bridge funds.
This latest investment, when combined with the previously announced investment over the last two years, will have raised the minimum stipend by about 35%, bringing the university increase in graduate student support to $22 million.
Even with this new minimum, we expect around 80% of graduate students will receive stipends above that amount. We are also engaging with each college for a careful review to achieve competitive stipend levels for their respective disciplines.
The university will also be supporting a new Presidential Excellence PhD Award to assist with recruiting top students. These awards will be a $10,000 supplement on top of a base stipend over a period of four years. Recipients of the award are expected to maintain satisfactory academic and research progress as defined by their academic unit and research advisor and to participate in professional development and mentoring activities organized for award recipients. Each year 100 new awards will be offered. Colleges’ allocations will be proportional to their PhD student enrollment.
In total, the university now invests $229 million in graduate student stipends and fellowships.
We are also pleased to announce the anticipated launch in January of a training module for graduate students on freedom of expression and free inquiry. More information, including frequently asked questions, will be posted to the Human Resources and Vice Provost for Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Scholars websites.
Again, we thank you for your contributions to excellence at scale at Purdue University.

Purdue trustees approve Daniels School building construction,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
To accommodate student enrollment growth across the university and strategic initiatives in the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, Purdue University trustees on Friday (Dec. 8) gave approval to plan, finance, construct and award construction contracts for an approximately 164,000-square-foot building near the intersection of Mitch Daniels Boulevard and Sheetz Street on the West Lafayette campus.
The facility, which will include new flexible space in support of academic instruction and conferences, will provide modern teaching and research labs for financial trading, data visualization, behavioral research and experiential learning. The building will feature one floor below ground and five above ground, as well as mechanical space on the sixth floor.
To support Purdue’s Classroom Master Plan, the building will feature three large general-purpose, centrally scheduled classrooms — one accommodating 500 students and two accommodating 250 students apiece.
The building, which will be connected to the Krannert Building immediately to its east, will give the Daniels School three facilities, joining the Krannert Building and Jerry S. Rawls Hall. All are connected, both above and below ground.
The new facility will be the second-largest classroom building on the Purdue campus, behind only the Wilmeth Active Learning Center.
“We’re thrilled with what our design committee and architects have drafted,” said Jim Bullard, the Dr. Samuel R. Allen Dean of the Daniels School. “First, with its striking transparent exterior, the building will draw students, faculty, alumni and visitors to campus inside to see what’s happening.
“More importantly, it is a student-centered building. It will provide learning environments and study spaces at the cutting edge of business school facilities. There will be space for research centers and partnership opportunities with practitioners, as well as student advising areas. Our large classroom spaces will accommodate not only business school students, but those from other schools and units on campus.”
The scope and location of this project aligns with the Daniels School master plan and the 2018 Giant Leaps campus master plan.
Demand has never been higher for a Purdue business education. The Daniels School is expected to enroll 4,000 students in fall 2024, up more than 1,600 students from five years ago. Applications were up 18% this fall from a year ago. The new building has to be large enough to house a burgeoning student population while also creating a collaborative culture.
As part of the project, a portion of the first floor of the adjacent Krannert Building will be renovated. The nearby Krannert Center for Executive Education and Research and the Wesley Foundation facilities will be demolished.
Construction is scheduled to begin in July 2024 and be completed in April 2027. The estimated total project cost of $168 million will be financed by gift funds. Of the total, $125 million will be for the new building and related utility work, while the remaining $43 million will be for the three large classrooms, land acquisition and building demolition, renovations to the Krannert Building, and miscellaneous additional site work.
In other action, trustees gave approval to: Plan, finance, construct and award construction contracts for the Burke Boilermaker Aquatic Center mechanical project on the West Lafayette campus. This project will replace five air handling units and condensers with new units served by campus chilled water. Additionally, new chilled water piping, pumps and heat exchangers and temperature controls will be installed, and supporting electrical, mechanical and sprinkler systems will be adjusted. The result will be improved reliability, dehumidification and indoor air quality. Work is scheduled to begin in December 2025 and be completed in April 2027. The estimated cost of $11.75 million will be financed by Auxiliary Funds — Other ($8.15 million) and Auxiliary Funds — Athletics ($3.6 million).
Plan, finance, construct and award construction contracts for the music center addition at Purdue Fort Wayne.

"Purdue trustees endorse 13th consecutive tuition freeze; approve updated housing, dining plans","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue University Board of Trustees on Friday (Dec. 8) endorsed President Mung Chiang’s request for a 13th consecutive tuition freeze, meaning students will see no increase in tuition through at least the 2025-26 academic year.
The freeze — to be formally approved by trustees in late spring 2025 per state statute, after the legislative budget setting — means base undergraduate tuition at Purdue will remain at $9,992 per year for Indiana residents and $28,794 for out-of-state students through 2025-26.
“Purdue continues to lead affordability and student access by offering higher education at the highest proven value,” Chiang said. “Each year we evaluate the financial condition of the university, and we continue to grow the 62% part of the annual operating budget that is outside of undergraduate tuition.”
Trustees chair Mike Berghoff said, “While we have become accustomed to annual tuition freezes, making this decision is not something we do automatically. In consultation with the Office of the Treasurer, we carefully evaluate each freeze for viability. We are pleased to endorse President Chiang’s request.”
President Emeritus Mitch Daniels first announced that Purdue would not increase tuition in spring 2013, shortly after he became the university’s 12th president. Before that, Purdue tuition had increased every year since 1976, and it rose an average of nearly 6% annually from 2002-12.
One-year loan borrowing per Purdue undergraduate has decreased by 40% since 2012. Savings for Boilermaker students and their families will total more than $1.4 billion for educational and living expenses by 2025-26, versus what they would have paid if Purdue had raised tuition and fees at the national average. Annual in-state tuition would be $1,400 higher today if Purdue had followed the national trend.
By 2025-26, 11 graduating classes will have never experienced a tuition increase during their time at Purdue.
In 2023, the average earnings-to-debt ratio for Purdue graduates was 6.02.
While 100% of students pay tuition, about 40% live in university residences. In order to ensure sustainability of quality without subsidy from the other 60% — despite the inflationary increase in the costs of food, construction, repair, insurance and utilities — trustees approved a tiered increase in housing rates for the 2024-25 academic year.
For over 83% of rooms, including those with the highest demand, the average increase will be less than $29 per month. At the same time, Purdue is committed to investing in the maintenance of its residence halls — both rooms and common areas — with a commitment to invest an additional $5 million annually in repairs and rehabilitation for a self-sustaining residence hall system.
After this update, Purdue’s rates will remain the most affordable by a wide margin in 2024-25 among Big Ten universities, as compared to 2012, when its rates were the second-most expensive in the Big Ten.
“As we continue seeing significant demand for on-campus living, Purdue is proud to be taking the necessary steps to sustain quality,” said Beth McCuskey, Purdue vice provost for student life. “Continuing maintenance and enhancements to existing halls will provide quality living and learning environments that position students to succeed.”
The Action Council on Student Housing and Well-Being has been collecting input on dining plans. In recognizing that the dining court experience is a core component of residential life at Purdue — one that builds community and supports well-being and success — future meal plans will reflect simplicity and flexibility, as well as affordability. With an annual price ranging from $1,700-$5,695, rates will continue to remain below the Big Ten average, and students can select a plan that fits their needs and budget. Plans will consist of meal swipes used at residential dining facilities and Dining Dollars that can be used at any campus retail location. This eliminates restrictions and confusion on where and when students can eat using their meal plan. Students also will have more flexibility in how they use their meal plans regarding portions, value and time of day.
“On-campus living is such a dynamic piece of the student experience at Purdue, and the trustees extend our thanks to our students and their parents, Purdue Student Government and Purdue Graduate Student Government, and the Action Council on Student Housing and Well-Being for their feedback, input, patience and collaborative work in creating an environment for all Boilermakers to feel at home when it comes to campus life,” Berghoff said.

Commercial air service returns to Purdue University Airport,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University and Surf Air Mobility Inc. (NYSE: SRFM) have agreed to begin scheduled commuter air service between West Lafayette/Purdue University Airport (LAF) and Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport (ORD) with a target start date in early second quarter 2024. This marks the return of commercial air service for the first time since 2004 to LAF, Indiana’s second-busiest airport in terms of total annual aircraft operations.
Purdue University has a renowned history in aviation that includes Amelia Earhart, who was an instructor and advisor in careers for women. Earhart flew out of Purdue University Airport in the 1930s, when it became the nation’s first university-owned airport.
Purdue and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation will provide funding to support the air service’s establishment and ongoing operations. Flight operations will be run by Southern Airways Express, an airline subsidiary of Surf Air Mobility. Southern Airways will operate flights between LAF and ORD seven days a week, with 24 weekly round-trip flights currently planned.
University officials said it is thanks to support from the community, region and state, local corporate partners, local government, and Greater Lafayette Commerce (GLC), among others, that made possible the return of air service to the region. Earlier in 2023, the university approved runway improvement through Federal Aviation Administration funding, and the region funded a new terminal through the READI program from IEDC.
Commercial air service is part of the “Purdue Flies” initiative, which will expand Discovery Park District at Purdue; serve the Greater Lafayette community; further accelerate economic growth; and synergize with the teaching, research and innovation of the future of modern air mobility that amplify the heritage of flying at Purdue University.
Pending Board of Trustees approval in February, the new terminal will be named for Amelia Earhart, thanks to approval from the Earhart estate. The approximately 8,000-square-foot facility — to be located west of the existing terminal — will include a waiting area, baggage claim, ticketing, passenger screening and public restrooms. It will be constructed to comply with Transportation Security Administration and FAA requirements.
In addition, Purdue trustees have approved a plan to finance, construct and award construction contracts for the rehabilitation of a Purdue University Airport runway. The project will repave Runway 5/23. Also, a small connector taxiway will be relocated and reconstructed, and a second taxiway that is no longer used will be eliminated. Work is scheduled to start in May 2024 and be completed in June 2024.
The Purdue Flies initiative furthers Purdue President Mung Chiang’s ABCD strategy, in which the A stands for airport and aims to provide the university’s students, faculty, staff and families, as well as residents and businesses in the Greater Lafayette area, with easier, faster connections to the world via O’Hare, the fourth-busiest airport in America. With air service between LAF and O’Hare, travelers will be able to skip the multi-hour drive, traffic congestion, offsite parking, shuttle train, and long security and luggage lines, and instead fly directly into the terminals and walk gate to gate.
“Purdue and the neighboring community are pleased to welcome Southern Airways Express to the Purdue University Airport,” Chiang said. “We could not do this without the outstanding support of Gov. Eric Holcomb, IEDC, the mayors of both Lafayette and West Lafayette, GLC, the FAA and countless others. With the economic growth momentum here, I know that Purdue faculty, staff, students and alumni will be thrilled for the university and local communities to once again have direct access to the global aviation network after 20 years without scheduled commercial airline service.
“Additionally, as home to one of the top aviation technology and aerospace engineering programs in the country, we look forward to exploring innovation, educational and career opportunities for our students. ‘Purdue Flies’ delivers our ABCD strategy to serve the state and country, further accelerating job creation and prosperity in Greater Lafayette. And the opportunity to honor Amelia Earhart makes it even more special.”
Surf Air Mobility has existing federal contracts through the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, in which it operates subsidized routes connecting communities that otherwise lack access to minimal air service. The agreement with Purdue University replicates the EAS model with a private institution without the need for federal funding.
“We’re excited to take the basic principle of the EAS program and build on its success with Purdue University,” said Stan Little, CEO of Surf Air Mobility. “We hope this will be a model we can replicate with other non-urban universities and private companies in the future. As the growth in Surf Air Mobility continues, partners like Purdue University will be integral to accelerating a new kind of mass transportation solution that uses smaller aircraft connecting smaller regional airports to the nation’s air infrastructure.”
Through Southern’s interline and distribution agreements with United Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines, West Lafayette passengers will be able to have a seamless connection experience at the hub, including through-bag transfer, and they will also be able to purchase tickets on United.com, aa.com and AlaskaAir.com.
“Today’s announcement is a win for all Lafayette and West Lafayette area residents,” said Rob Wynkoop, Purdue vice president for administrative operations. “No longer will we have to deal with the uncertainty of the long drive to take advantage of all the flights and destinations that O’Hare has to offer. Passengers will save money and time while being able to support their local airport. With new airline service from Southern and the new passenger terminal coming next year, it is an exciting time for the Purdue University Airport. And more destinations are to come, we hope.”
Southern will operate these flights using Cessna Grand Caravan turboprop aircraft, with nine passenger seats and two pilots. The flights will be open to the general public, and Purdue will provide the use of its passenger terminal, hangar space and ramp access for Southern’s personnel. Southern will also offer job opportunities pre- and post-graduation for qualified students.
David Rosenberg, Indiana secretary of commerce:
“This is an exciting day and an important milestone for all of our great partners at Purdue University, the Lafayette-West Lafayette community, the state of Indiana and our ongoing talent retention and attraction efforts. As a state, and under the leadership of Gov. Eric J. Holcomb, we are investing in quality of place and quality of life like never before. Increased connectivity — particularly to and from a truly global destination like Purdue — is a significant contributor to advancing community and economic vitality, and we are thrilled to welcome Southern Airways to Indiana, reviving commercial air service for students, educators, innovators and visitors alike.”
John Dennis, West Lafayette mayor:
“The idea of having an airport here that can support a major carrier is absolutely phenomenal. It’s great on the social level, it’s great on the international level, and, obviously, it’s super great on the economic level.”
Tony Roswarski, Lafayette mayor:
“We’ve been working on bringing back commercial air service for several years. We’ve all committed $7 million [in Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative, or READI, funds] to help do the upgrades and construct the terminal that’s needed to make this possible. It’s been a collaborative community effort to bring all these pieces together.”
Scott Walker, President and CEO, Greater Lafayette Commerce:
“Commercial service at the Purdue Airport matters to businesses, which make strategic location decisions that then get noticed by the development community. Leisure is also a big activity in this area. Having a carrier that can allow residents to get to their destinations easier will also be a significant enhancement to our quality of life in the Greater Lafayette region.”

Said Hall: “These are exciting times at Purdue, and this is truly an honor to lead and advance the university’s recruitment efforts in attracting the best and brightest students. There are few roles more vital to our strategic efforts and student success than enrollment management and Purdue’s land-grant mission in growing the knowledge of the next generation of Boilermakers and global leaders.”
A graduate of Purdue’s Department of Agricultural Economics, Hall has worked in various strategic and financial roles across the university for more than two decades. She served as director of financial affairs for the College of Agriculture for nine years before taking on her role in the Office of the Provost in 2018 and her most recent promotion to vice provost for finance and strategic initiatives two years ago.
In this new office within the Office of the Provost, Grundy will work closely with campus faculty and leadership to advance its directive to encourage and support faculty in seeking external awards and prestigious recognitions. To facilitate the effort, the faculty affairs website has been updated to include two new submission forms. Grundy will lead the support team in this office and report to Sunil Prabhakar, vice provost for faculty affairs.
Grundy currently serves as assistant director of faculty external recognition in the College of Engineering. In that role, he prepares nomination packages while using various data sources to strengthen the evidence base for nomination decisions by College of Engineering leadership and to support institutional benchmarking. Grundy came to Purdue in 2019 as faculty awards specialist in the College of Engineering. He earned his bachelor’s degree from York University, master’s degree from Carleton University and PhD from York University.
Dr. Adams, executive director of Health Equity Initiatives, will lead a search advisory committee to find the next dean of the College of Health and Human Sciences. Provost Wolfe will solicit suggestions for members for the search advisory committee, and the group will begin meeting in January.
“As the 20th U.S. Surgeon General and former Indiana State Health Commissioner, Dr. Adams has been at the forefront of America’s most pressing health challenges, and brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this role,” Wolfe said.
Marion Underwood, who had served as HHS dean since coming to Purdue in 2018, stepped down to become the next provost and executive vice president at Colorado State University. Health sciences professor Aaron Bowman, head of Purdue’s School of Health Sciences since 2018, has served as interim HHS dean since Nov. 1 and will continue to serve in this capacity until the next leader is in place.
A national search will be launched for the leader of Purdue’s Office for Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Scholars in early January. Overseeing graduate student programs, this position will focus on maximizing the success of and support for graduate and professional students and postdoctoral scholars across all departments and colleges. Purdue offers over 70 departmental and interdisciplinary graduate programs, including degree, nondegree and certificate programs. Each program includes research or study areas, which provide a total of more than 600 options.
Eric Barker, the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean of the College of Pharmacy, has filled the additional role of (acting) associate provost for graduate programs since June. Earlier in the year, Barker accepted Wolfe’s request to undertake a thoughtful study of Purdue’s graduate student programs.
Master’s and PhD students are the engine that powers leading research universities like Purdue, which is investing nearly $20 million over two years in raising student stipends and launching the Presidential Doctoral Excellence Awards. Barker and Wolfe, through further consultation with students and faculty, have expanded support for graduate programs at the department, college and university levels with the following principles:
The North Star is student success. More resources are being devoted to students and processes streamlined and maximized to ease the life of graduate students as the programs grow simultaneously in size and quality.
All essential centralized functionalities at the university level are continued, including hosting certain interdisciplinary graduate degree programs.
Additional resources and support for master’s, doctoral, and professional degree students will be provided.
A national search will be launched in early January for the next leader of the John Martinson Honors College and honors programs. This position will oversee Purdue’s campuswide academic honors efforts, including the John Martinson Honors College.
Since May, Jenna Rickus, vice provost for teaching and learning, has been heading the Honors College team to create a leadership transition strategy as the college celebrates its 10th anniversary. She has used this time of transition to reflect on accomplishments, excellence and areas of growth and improvement – utilizing study and conversations with stakeholders to set a trajectory of accelerated forward momentum into the college’s second decade. The John Martinson Honors College is recognized as a Top 20 Honors College in the U.S. by College Transitions and a Top Fulbright Producer for the U.S. Student Program.

Staff Excellence: Payroll and Tax Services,"summarize:Thousands of Purdue University and Purdue Global faculty and staff set out to work each day to support their families, lifestyles and futures, and thanks to the persistence of the university’s Payroll and Tax Services team, they know they’ll go home with accurate and timely compensation for their efforts.
“We work diligently every day to ensure employees are paid correctly and on time,” says Candace Shaffer, associate vice president of benefits and payroll. “If we fail, not only do we negatively affect the lives of our employees, but we also weaken the integrity of the university and positive strides in employee and student relations. Each member of our team takes their jobs very seriously and understands that their positions impact your lives.”
Led by Shaffer, the 18 members who make up the Payroll and Tax Services team work behind the scenes to process biweekly and monthly checks for approximately 31,000 systemwide Purdue and Purdue Applied Research Institute employees and 2,800 Purdue Global employees. In 2022, the group’s efficient operations led to the distribution of more than $1 billion in taxable income.
Always striving for excellence, Payroll and Tax Services is continually evolving its timekeeping, payroll and tax services procedures to better support the university and the individuals who constitute its workforce. In recent years, the team has implemented updated processes for remote I-9s to serve the university’s growing number of remote and hybrid employees, operationalized a wage overpayment dashboard and developed key performance indicators to work toward creating a perfect payroll system.
The team also holds the responsibility of ensuring Purdue’s hiring and pay processes are compliant with state and federal requirements. To do so, they have expanded resources for onboarding, I-9s and taxes to guarantee that the university’s 14,000 new hires each year have the tools to navigate its required compliance following the start of their careers at Purdue.
Providing extraordinary customer service is a daily affair for this group of experts, who always take care to address any question or request that comes their way. As the bridge between employee master data management and finance, the team works diligently to minimize issues across campus by fielding approximately 36,000 inquiries each year related to garnishments, timekeeping, payroll processing, tax services, and I-9 and work authorization.
Without the exceptional efforts of Payroll and Tax Services, many of the university’s operations would slow to a halt. Beyond its mission to serve Purdue employees, Payroll and Tax Services strives to constantly improve system stability, processes and customer service, underscoring the team’s endless pursuit of excellence at scale within the campus community.","[{'summary_text': 'Payroll and Tax Services field approximately 36,000 inquiries each year related to garnishments, timekeeping, payroll processing, tax services, and I-9s . in 2022, the group’s efficient operations led to the distribution of more than $1 billion in taxable income .'}]"
"New faculty activity reporting system, Elements, launching in January","summarize:The Office of the Provost and Institutional Data Analytics + Assessment are pleased to share that Elements, the university’s new faculty activity reporting system, will be available to faculty and staff Jan. 2, 2024.
“The upcoming implementation of Elements fills a long-standing need. It will become a comprehensive source of faculty profiles and accomplishments,” says Sunil Prabhakar, vice provost for faculty affairs. “This central resource will provide a consistent, reliable source of data about faculty productivity and impact, enhance internal and external faculty visibility, promote the reputation of the university, and ease data collection and reporting for several university needs.”
Users will be able to access Elements with their Purdue login via the link on the Faculty Affairs website. Training resources are under development and will be available on the Faculty Affairs website closer to the launch date.
Each college has one or more College Success Manager who will be able to assist faculty and staff in their college with questions about Elements.
Elements is a streamlined tool that will allow faculty and leadership to collect and view data such as research awards, publications, presentations and teaching innovations in one location. Elements will pull data from multiple university data sources, including Sponsored Programs, Banner and Human Resources, as well as from external publication databases. With this data, faculty will be able to create a comprehensive profile that will facilitate collaboration both internally and externally. The data will be used for several reporting functions, including accreditation and strategic initiative reporting. Use of the tool will reduce manual entry and ultimately save faculty time.
The Office of the Provost highly encourages departments to utilize Elements for annual reviews for the 2023-24 academic year. Elements will not immediately be used for promotion and tenure processes; however, the goal is to incorporate it into promotion and tenure processes in the future.
Faculty and staff can review information about Elements, including a detailed FAQ, on the Faculty Affairs website.","[{'summary_text': ""Elements, the university's new faculty activity reporting system, will be available to faculty and staff Jan. 2, 2024 . users will be able to access Elements with their Purdue login via the link on the Faculty Affairs website .""}]"
Research team explores genomic options to enhance honeybee resilience,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Beekeepers lose between 30% and 40% of their colonies annually, mostly to parasites and pathogens. Losses during one bad year in Indiana reached 60%.
“The traditional methods of bee breeding have been around for nearly 100 years,” said Purdue University’s Brock Harpur, assistant professor of entomology. Although breeders have made progress, many of their methods remain unchanged even with the recent availability of affordable gene sequencing.
“The honeybee genome was sequenced in 2006. There really hasn’t been a lot of bee breeding in this country that’s been empowered by that resource,” he said. Harpur aims to change that with Purdue’s Luiz Brito, associate professor of animal sciences, and Gregor Gorjanc of the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. They seek to validate genomic breeding tools while designing a system that bee breeders can implement themselves.
Their work is among the projects supported by $11.6 million in grants allocated from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture earlier this year to promote healthy pollinator populations. Agricultural pollination production from the beekeeping industry in the U.S. is valued at more than $19 billion annually.
“That excludes honey production, which is another huge industry,” Harpur said. “Bee breeding is central to that. Beekeepers historically have responded to industry threats with breeding. The goal here is to help them do that better with genomics resources.”
Five years ago, with genetic samples priced at $400 each, that prospect would have been costly. But the price has dropped to about $50 per sample. A 2017 economic case study of Canadian honeybee colonies assessed the value of an expensive sequencing technology.
“They were looking at one trait versus the many we’re hoping to predict,” Harpur said. “They showed that if a beekeeper used these more expensive genome-enabled breeding techniques, they could increase their profits by between 9% and 96%. Using genomic technology, we think we can increase the amount of money that beekeepers make.”
Harpur’s lab, which operates a gene sequencing service for beekeepers, has sequenced nearly 2,000 samples from across the country. “If you’re a beekeeper, you can send us a bee, and we’ll sequence it and tell you about it and where it’s from,” he said.
Harpur can use the genotypes from that same database to see how effectively they predict breeding values under ideal conditions. He also uses simulated datasets to explore the statistical validity of his approach on supercomputers at Purdue’s Rosen Center for Advanced Computing.
The simulations allow the researchers to assess how many samples are enough to statistically validate their goals.
“If we have a thousand samples, is that enough?” Harpur said. “Do we need 10 times more? A hundred times more? And furthermore, if those thousand samples come from 10 different populations, does that matter?”
The computer simulations also enable the scientists to analyze thousands or millions of honeybee genomes with many different histories and from many different situations to see how well their genomic predictions fit reality. The simulations can even help identify which of the many available genome sequencing methods might work best, Harpur noted.
Harpur works closely with bee breeding organizations nationally, especially the Indiana Queen Breeders Association. Some trials and genomic data collection already have begun. “We’re going to start local, show that this works and then move to a more global scale,” he said.
As an evolutionary biologist, Harpur sees the project as a way to answer questions both for bee breeding and for basic science. How does the artificial selection of bee breeding affect bee colonies, which consist of tens of thousands of highly social individuals?
“They’re all genetically related, and they all collectively manifest these traits that we’re interested in,” he said. “When I talk about honey production, that’s not the action of one bee. That’s the action of thousands of related bees.
“So, when you make a prediction on a single genome for a trait that thousands of individuals contributed to, how exactly does that math work out? And how exactly does selection work in a case like that?”","[{'summary_text': 'beekeepers lose between 30% and 40% of their colonies annually, mostly to parasites and pathogens .

"Reimagining higher education with empathy, equity and belonging are key components for success, says Purdue Global chief diversity officer","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Tiffany Townsend grew up with the dream and goal of changing people’s lives.
She believed becoming a clinical psychologist would be the best way to bring help, healing and understanding to others.
As she continued her journey through academia, she wondered how she could make a larger impact, especially for underserved student populations and scholars of color in higher education institutions.
“I started asking, ‘How can I increase access? What can I do to have a broader impact?’ During the COVID-19 pandemic we realized that we don’t have to be in the same place to work together,” says Townsend, who serves as Purdue Global’s chief diversity officer and vice president of organizational culture. “I started thinking differently about my work, work environments and ways technology can help to increase access.”
Those different ways of thinking — and doing — are paying off.
Purdue Global selected by Gardner Institute to join inaugural cohort of Transforming the Foundational Postsecondary Experience
Purdue Global looks to expand education opportunities for working adults
Intentionality, strategy drive Purdue Global business dean for student growth
Townsend, originally from the Washington, D.C., area, earned her undergraduate degree from Spelman College in Atlanta and her doctorate in clinical psychology from George Washington University.
Her first faculty appointment was in Pennsylvania State University’s clinical psychology program, where she trained students to be researchers and clinicians. Townsend was at Georgetown University’s School of Medicine when she received an offer that intrigued her.
Townsend was approached to manage the American Psychological Association’s Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs.
“At first, I did not think I would be interested,” she says. But she soon reconsidered. “I wanted to explore and learn more about the administrative side of academia and nonprofits. I had started doing applied research in communities of color and appreciated how impactful that was and how there were very few scholars of color, especially those that were doing research. While working with APA, I had a much broader reach. The position gave me an opportunity to impact more lives and help more people.”
In her new role, Townsend was able to open the door for more scholars and researchers of color.
But academic administration kept calling.
“I missed higher education,” Townsend says. “I saw myself as a researcher as it was part of my professional identity.”
Townsend returned to academia as Augusta University’s chief diversity officer and associate professor of psychological sciences.
As the COVID-19 pandemic marched through 2020 and 2021, Townsend watched the shifting landscape of higher education as administrators and society struggled to ensure equity for all students in all settings.
And then a job posting caught her eye.
Purdue Global, which is Purdue’s online university for working adults, was hiring a chief diversity officer. Its student body was the type of population for which Townsend was wanting to increase access to higher education and upward mobility. Purdue’s strong connection to the online school also impressed her.
Purdue Global’s student population currently comprises the following:
59% of students are 30 or older.
40% of students are from underserved populations.
52% of students have a child or other dependents.
50% are first-generation college students.
Approximately 10,000 are military-affiliated students, a population that includes uniformed personnel, veterans and eligible dependents.
“That’s what excited me about Purdue Global — I could do this work and reach many more students, specifically nontraditional students,” Townsend says. “If equity is really what I’m wanting to do, what better place to do that than in an institution whose mission is focused on serving traditionally underserved students.”
In addition to establishing a vision, Townsend has a goal of building inclusive excellence, which involves being thoughtful and intentional in everything that is done for students, staff and faculty. Focusing on equity improves the quality of the institution as a whole.
“We are creating something new. Purdue Global felt like an opportunity unlike any in my career to put my footprint down and help to structure and change things from the beginning,” she says. “My team is helping develop this excellence in the culture of the institution from the very beginning so it is part of the fabric of the university.”
Several initiatives led by Townsend are underway exploring collaboration and community building. Purdue Global recently received a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a plan to ensure equitable access and support the success of Black, Latino, Indigenous and low-income students. Key to this plan are strategies that will help to create a sense of community and foster the persistence and ultimate graduation of all students, regardless of their background.
Purdue Global was also announced as a member of the Gardner Institute’s first cohort of 11 institutions across the U.S. that will transform the first two years of a student’s college education to help them be more successful on their path to earning a degree.
“We have to look at the full student journey and identify pain points or points of opportunity and then work with the areas to identify strategies to address those points,” Townsend says. “We are making data-informed decisions. The best practices involve using data and analytics to inform our efforts and then produce research and original scholarship based on this work so we can disseminate our findings to other professionals in this field.”
Another goal is to build community, which can be challenging for an online higher education institution.
Townsend and her team are looking for new ways to engage with students and learn together, especially in building connections.
“It will help students feel more engaged with the institution and also help build community and relationships,” she says. “This is critical if we want to make sure our students feel supported, that as an institution we are rooting for them to be successful.”
Townsend continually monitors the present while planning for the future. Townsend is on the go with her two kids, participating in as many activities as she can. She is an active member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. and Jack and Jill of America Inc. She and her husband enjoy reading, as well as spending time with her father.
But many of her activities have her thinking of her children and their ability to access higher education and careers in the not-so-distant future.
“We are here to support students’ success. If we can make sure that they feel like they belong, we know that they’re going to be more successful. Our focus is how we are creating fertile ground where success can grow,” she says.
Student success to her is when a student achieves their goal of earning a degree that could lead to increased employability and upward mobility that improves outcomes for their families and communities.
Townsend relies on data to make decisions, and one data point she is monitoring is the enrollment cliff and demographic shift in higher education.
“The traditional student no longer looks like who we typically think of as a college student. We are going to have to shift the way in which we structure the university to support students,” she says. “We have to rethink higher education from the ground up. We need to structure it with diversity of students, their needs, competitive marketplace and the global economy in mind. It’s going to make us think outside the box.”
One highlight for her is attending Purdue Global’s commencement ceremonies, where students and their families are celebrating those comebacks.
“You feel the emotion; you know how important this is. And you say, ‘This is all worth it. This is why I do it. This is why I feel this work is important,’” Townsend says.
And of her own comeback?
It was when she made that leap from academic faculty to administrator with the American Psychological Association.
“It was important for me to help train the next generation of leaders and to open the doors for underrepresented students because I understand how important education is to their quality of life,” she says. “I know what education has meant for me. I want to make sure other students have that opportunity also.”
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey.

Purdue drafts guidance on AI use in teaching and learning,"summarize:Artificial intelligence continues to emerge as a powerful tool for education. Purdue is committed to being at the forefront of translating research to practice and extending the frontiers of excellence in teaching and learning. To that end, Purdue’s Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning has issued draft guidance for instructors on the use of AI in Purdue courses and learning environments for spring 2024, with input since summer from University Senate leadership, the Ad Hoc Committee on AI, the Center for Instructional Excellence, and the Innovation Hub.
The draft guidance can be viewed on the Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning webpage. Topics covered include academic integrity, syllabus statements, AI detection tools and instructor responsibilities regarding grading, as well as copyright, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and privacy considerations.
The Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning is seeking feedback on this guidance and welcomes input, via the Qualtrics survey on the office’s website, from faculty and staff teaching Purdue courses. The survey will remain open for feedback and review until Dec. 31. The Spring 2024 guidance will be finalized and published on Jan. 2. This guidance will be updated each semester.
This guidance will continue to evolve each semester as more feedback is obtained and instructors continue to explore the opportunities these tools provide in the classroom. Separate from this guidance to instructors, Vice Provost Jenna Rickus will continue to collaborate with the University Senate on possible future updates to the academic regulations that may codify AI considerations into university policy.
The Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning will hold a town hall in spring 2024 to solicit additional feedback and discuss the future direction of AI in teaching and learning. A date and more information on this event are forthcoming. In addition to faculty and staff, students will be invited to the town hall, building on conversations that took place with new students during Boiler Gold Rush this semester.
To develop the most effective and comprehensive draft guidance, university leaders have collaborated with multiple entities across campus, as mentioned above. Their efforts include funding an AI Innovation Fellow, Lindsay Hamm, at the Innovation Hub to help expand the transdisciplinary network of faculty and staff who are engaged with the innovative integration of AI tools into their teaching. The Innovation Hub also funded a series of AI in teaching and learning grants to provide faculty and staff the opportunity to rapidly deploy experiments for teaching and learning in an AI-rich environment and better understand dimensions of how AI might shape the future of education. On the Teaching@Purdue website, the Innovative Learning Team has compiled resources and suggestions for instructors who want to explore generative AI in their teaching practice.
All instructors are encouraged to explore these resources, reach out to the Innovative Learning Team, or participate in Teaching & Learning Community of Practice events this spring.","[{'summary_text': 'the draft guidance can be viewed on the Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning’s website . topics covered include academic integrity, syllabus statements, AI detection tools and instructor responsibilities regarding grading .'}]"

Purdue’s new institute for advanced system integration and packaging honors Boilermaker and innovative visionary in semiconductors,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University will recognize the impact of alumnus and semiconductor pioneer John Atalla with the naming of the newest system integration and packaging research institute on campus.
The Atalla Institute for Advanced System Integration and Packaging (ASIP) will honor Purdue graduate Martin (John) M. Atalla, known as the co-inventor of the silicon MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), one of the most widely used types of integrated circuits in microchips. With an estimated 10^22 silicon MOSFETs made so far and many more to come, it is the most manufactured invention in history. Atalla’s work led to the chips that make many aspects of daily life possible today.

“The work of Atalla and his team at Bell Labs led to the demonstration of the first silicon MOSFET in 1959 and blazed the trail for modern integrated circuit chips,” said Mark Lundstrom, Purdue’s chief semiconductor officer. “Our students and faculty can now honor his name by continuing to further his work.”
Atalla studied mechanical engineering at Purdue, receiving a master’s degree in 1947 and a doctorate in 1949. He was honored as a Purdue Distinguished Engineering Alumnus in 2002.
Purdue’s Institute for Advanced System Integration and Packaging was announced in October during the university’s Semiconductor Week. Bringing together four on-campus research centers, the institute builds on Purdue’s established research in advanced packaging and system integration and puts new focus on advanced electronic systems in packages, which are widely expected to drive progress in electronic systems in the decades to come.
After Purdue, Atalla began investigating the surface properties of silicon semiconductors at Bell Laboratories. His work led to the emergence of the silicon MOSFET in 1960. The next year, Atalla joined Hewlett-Packard and became the first manager of HP’s Semiconductor Lab. In 1969 he joined Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.
The Atalla Corp. was founded in 1972 to address security problems in banking. In 1990 Atalla retired, renowned as the inventor of the PIN, or personal identification number, and the Atalla Box, which at one point secured 80% of all ATM transactions worldwide. Atalla returned to work in 1993, focusing on encryption technology for the internet, and founded TriStrata Corp. in 1996.
He was a native of Port Said, Egypt, and died in 2009 at age 85.
ASIP will host its first international workshop this week, with industry and academic leaders in attendance to address the challenges to research, “lab-to-fab” translation and workforce necessary to build future microelectronic systems. The workshop was hosted in partnership with the Applied Research Institute, host of the Silicon Crossroads Microelectronics Commons Hub; imec USA; Cadence; and Osaka University.
The need for microchips in areas from computing, mobile communications and vehicles to defense and biological applications requires future advanced system integration and packaging like that represented by Purdue’s research.

Purdue University wins patent infringement lawsuit against STMicroelectronics,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University has won its patent infringement lawsuit against STMicroelectronics.
U.S. patent 7,498,633 covers groundbreaking technology involving silicon carbide semiconductors invented by Purdue’s James Cooper and his graduate student/postdoctoral researcher Asmita Saha. On Dec. 4, a jury returned a verdict in Purdue’s favor, finding that ST infringed the patent by selling infringing silicon carbide semiconductors. The jury awarded Purdue $32.5 million in past compensatory damages, plus a running royalty on future sales.
“Winning this case is a great victory for Purdue,” said Brian Edelman, Purdue Research Foundation (PRF) president. “As the university’s tech transfer and commercialization arm, we take managing and protecting Purdue intellectual property very seriously, and we hold ourselves and others accountable to the highest standards. Our preference is to reach a licensing agreement, but we have a moral obligation to protect Purdue IP, and that includes going to court to defend our rights. The jury recognized this semiconductor research from Purdue researchers, and the decision is great news for the inventors, Purdue University and Purdue Research Foundation.”
”Purdue University is a top 4 patent-generating university in America. As a public land-grant institution, we support inventors and entrepreneurs to translate research to societal impact,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “Through programs such as Purdue Innovates, we mentor students and faculty, foster a culture of discovery, license their world-changing technologies to market and protect their intellectual property rights as needed.”
“Purdue and its people deserve the benefit of the innovation for which our university is known worldwide,” said Mitch Daniels, Purdue Research Foundation board chairman. “Our work to protect that innovation against unfair exploitation has now been vindicated. We will continue to stand by our research and the great work being done at Purdue.”
As a land-grant university, Purdue University has the fiduciary and moral responsibility to protect inventions made by students and faculty. Purdue Research Foundation manages the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization (OTC), which operates the technology transfer process. OTC vets invention disclosures from university personnel, applies for patents and other intellectual property protections, and licenses innovations to established and startup companies worldwide. In the 2022 calendar year, PRF secured 192 patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, placing Purdue fourth among all U.S. universities.
“Purdue Research Foundation has seen the worldwide impact of research created at Purdue University’s campuses, colleges and schools,” said Brooke Beier, Purdue Innovates senior vice president. “We are pleased to be partners in licensing this government-funded intellectual property to industry, so it reaches the public and impacts people’s lives.”
Under the Bayh-Dole Act, contractors of inventions arising from federal government-funded research, such as U.S. universities, own, patent and commercialize inventions through licensing. At Purdue, revenues from licensing are distributed among the inventors, their affiliated departments and the Purdue Research Foundation, which reinvests back into the commercialization and innovation ecosystem.
“This case is representative of the diligent efforts PRF has made to protect Purdue innovations from unauthorized use,” said Ken Waite, Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization chief patent counsel and director of intellectual property. “Because of the impact on the public and Purdue University, PRF understands the importance of investing in the process to protect Purdue intellectual property.”
The Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization operates one of the most comprehensive technology transfer programs among leading research universities in the U.S. Services provided by this office support the economic development initiatives of Purdue University and benefit the university’s academic activities through commercializing, licensing and protecting Purdue intellectual property. In fiscal year 2023, the office reported 150 deals finalized with 203 technologies signed, 400 disclosures received and 218 issued U.S. patents. The office is managed by the Purdue Research Foundation, which received the 2019 Innovation and Economic Prosperity Universities Award for Place from the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. In 2020, IPWatchdog Institute ranked Purdue third nationally in startup creation and in the top 20 for patents. The Purdue Research Foundation is a private, nonprofit foundation created to advance the mission of Purdue University.

Discovery points to new approach to treating liver cancer,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A breakthrough in the understanding of the relationship between a naturally occurring enzyme and the liver cancer drug sorafenib could improve the effectiveness of the drug, which currently prolongs the life of liver cancer patients for only two to three months. A study of the relationship between the enzyme DDX5, liver cancer and sorafenib, published in the Nature journal Cell Death & Disease, points to the potential for a more effective therapy that combines existing anti-cancer drugs with treatments that spur production of this enzyme.
“If we can find a way to continuously express DDX5 in the liver during treatment, then sorafenib and other multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have much better anti-tumor efficacy,” said Ourania Andrisani, lead researcher and Distinguished Professor of Basic Medical Sciences in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Purdue University. “This is a foundational discovery, and from this, we can think of new ways to develop effective therapies for liver cancer.”
More than three-quarters of a million people worldwide die annually from liver cancer, and survival rates, even in affluent countries, remain poor, ranging from less than 10% in several European countries to 30% in Japan, according to a 2022 article published in the Journal of Hepatology. More than half of liver cancer cases worldwide are caused by chronic infection by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is one of Andrisani’s research topics. As part of her investigations into HBV, Andrisani is tracing the role of DDX5 in biosynthesis of the virus. DDX5 — one of a class of proteins called RNA helicases that modify the structure of RNA — is involved in all aspects of RNA biology.
In the new study Andrisani’s team tackles the relationship between DDX5 and sorafenib, a well-established treatment against liver cancer whose effectiveness is short-lived. In an analysis of liver cancer cells and health care records from patients treated with sorafenib, patients with higher levels of DDX5 lived longer than those with lower levels. Intriguingly, sorafenib itself decreased levels of DDX5 in liver cancer cells and liver cancer animal models, and RNA sequencing indicates that the drug activates genes indispensable to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, a series of molecular steps normally active during embryonic development of the liver and associated with liver cancer when improperly activated.
Next, using engineered liver cancer cells, the research team showed that boosting DDX5 protein levels improves the efficacy of sorafenib in reducing the growth of the liver tumors. The liver cancer cells were engineered to turn on production of the DDX5 protein when treated with the antibiotic doxycycline. Tumors generated from the engineered cells implanted in mice were treated with sorafenib either together with doxycycline or without doxycycline as a control. The tumors treated with doxycycline were significantly smaller by weight than those not spurred to produce high levels of DDX5. During a two-week treatment of the mice with sorafenib and doxycycline to make DDX5, the tumor weight was reduced by an average value of 50%, while doxycycline alone or sorafenib alone did not have a significant effect on tumor weight.
In previous work, Andrisani’s team found that DDX5 inhibits HBV replication and that levels of DDX5 drop with chronic HBV infection. Her work also shows that DDX5 helps to repress the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Andrisani said a potential therapy based on the new findings would involve delivering mRNA to liver cells, causing them to produce DDX5 protein, just as mRNA was used in the COVID-19 vaccine to direct cells to make the viral protein.
“We’re hopeful that this finding will inspire therapeutics that take advantage of this mechanism,” Andrisani said. “It would be a clean, neat approach because we could target the cancer cells within the liver and continue the treatment only for as long as the patient is taking sorafenib. Once the treatment is over, delivery of DDX5 mRNA will also stop.”
Andrisani, a member and program co-leader of the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research, collaborated with researchers at Purdue, the Cancer Research Center of Lyon in France, and China Pharmaceutical University.

‘Body internet’ may eliminate the need for smartphones by changing how we use technology,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
What if the end of the smartphone era is caused by the ability to use your skin — instead of a screen or even voice commands — to interface with the internet? Or by using your mind to control devices without looking at them?
Innovations being developed at Purdue University may not only help reverse the trend of putting every possible task on a smartphone or other single device, but also completely change how humans have interacted with devices so far.
In a few years, this might look like making a payment by touching a machine with your finger instead of with a credit card or smartphone. Maybe you could access a GPS route with your feet or transfer a file to someone by shaking their hand.
And in 15 to 20 years, imagine adjusting the thermostat of your home just by thinking that you want a cooler or warmer temperature.
Purdue professor Shreyas Sen’s lab is working to turn this future into a reality through inventions allowing your body to be your local internet connection for devices that you wear, hold or have within you, such as a pacemaker. People could do the same digital tasks and more, but use their physical touch and eventually their minds rather than a screen.

Purdue Innovates: Where the world’s biggest ideas get their start
“Right now, our gateway to the internet is this very exciting box in our hands. We find ourselves heads down looking at it for a significant fraction of our awake time. If that’s not the kind of the future we want, then technology needs to evolve,” said Sen, Purdue’s Elmore Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “Instead, the smartphone could be deconstructed and distributed all around you at suitable locations such that it becomes invisible to the eye.”
Smartwatches, wireless headphones and other wearable devices are already deconstructing some features of the smartphone. But a screen is still typically needed to interact with them. Even up-and-coming devices that don’t have screens, such as Humane’s clip-on AI Pin, require voice commands and are designed to be more of a smartphone replacement, still consolidating functions all into one device.
Sen’s lab has invented two ways that would allow humans to shift from simply coexisting with technology encased behind a screen or accessible through voice command to directly collaborating with it. Patent applications for these inventions have been filed through the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization.
One invention, called “Wi-R,” establishes an “internet” within your body that smartphones, laptops, smartwatches, insulin pumps, and other wearable or implantable devices can use to communicate with each other. You also can expand your internet network to other devices or even other humans through your touch. Maybe you could send a photo to someone by poking them, for example.
The other invention is a new brain implant concept that in a couple of decades might be available for humans to use for controlling technology with their thoughts. Sen’s lab published initial findings on this implant concept in Nature Electronics earlier this year, showing how it has the potential to solve key issues with developing implants for “mind control.” Nature Electronics also featured this research in its highlight on brain-computer interface advancements made in 2023.
The implant idea builds on discoveries Sen and his students made while they were inventing the technology behind Wi-R. This technology allows the human body to transfer data fast enough so that any device would only need to be in direct or close contact with the person’s skin to do what the person wants the device to do. From head to toe, the skin would be the interface of an internet network instead of a screen, effectively establishing a “body internet.”
What makes this technology possible is electric signals operating at a much lower frequency than Bluetooth or other radio signals that currently help connect devices. These low-frequency signals are in the so-called electro-quasistatic range on the electromagnetic spectrum. Using electro-quasistatic signals, Wi-R allows data transfer to be much faster than with Bluetooth communication and accessible only through a person’s skin.
In 2020, Sen, some of his former students, and other Purdue alumni founded the startup Ixana to commercialize Wi-R. How Wi-R is used in the real world will depend on how companies choose to turn it into a product. But earlier this year at CES, an annual technology trade show in Las Vegas, Sen and the Ixana team demonstrated that Wi-R can transmit music through touch.
They showed that when music is streaming from a smartphone in your hand, Wi-R allows you to transfer this music through your body and have it play out loud from another device, such as a speaker, only when you touch that device. They also showed how you could transfer the music to someone else by touching their skin, enabling that person to play your music out loud through another device in contact with their touch. (Watch this video to see how.)
In developing Wi-R, Sen’s lab became among the first to discover how humans could digitally communicate strictly through touch.
As Sen and his students explored the capabilities of these signals further, the lab also became the first to demonstrate electro-quasistatic signals enabling communication in the brain. This is possible using a brain implant Sen’s lab has invented that transmits these signals.
The idea is that eventually a human could use these implants, placed at key points within the brain, to control technology without even touching or looking at it. In the future, this might look like using your thoughts to turn on an oven or type and send a text message.
A brain implant for “mind control” isn’t a new idea, but electro-quasistatic signals would provide several advantages over other brain implant concepts intended for commanding technology with thoughts.
For one, this method would be wire-free inside the brain. Neuralink is beginning clinical trials on technology it’s developing that requires 64 wires to connect an implant to about a thousand electrodes throughout the brain. The wires and electrodes are meant to capture as many of a person’s thoughts as possible so that they can be translated to actions that control technology outside of the body.
The concept Sen is developing takes advantage of the brain’s natural ability to carry electrical signals very well. Brain tissue, rather than wires, would help transmit information to the implant using the electro-quasistatic signals. In theory, this implant concept could transmit data more than a hundred times faster than other methods being considered in place of wires.
Because the brain has billions of neurons, a wireless brain implant concept would need to transmit data at least as fast as tens of megabits per second to capture even a thousand neurons simultaneously. No technology can do that in the brain yet, Sen said, but electro-quasistatic communication so far shows the most potential.
“There’s no avoiding that humans are getting augmented by machines and that machines are constantly changing our lives,” Sen said. “But our research shows that it’s possible for these machines to help you without requiring you to always have to look at a screen.”
Sen’s research is funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation. The Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering is one of the university’s computing departments, which are part of the Purdue Computes initiative. Sen also is a researcher in the Scalable Manufacturing of Aware and Responsive Thin Films (SMART) Consortium at Purdue. This consortium is affiliated with the university’s Institute for Physical Artificial Intelligence.

In Print: ‘Sparse Graphical Modeling for High Dimensional Data’,"summarize:Sparse Graphical Modeling for High Dimensional Data: A Paradigm of Conditional Independence Tests
Faming Liang
Bochao Jia, Faming Liang
Chapman & Hall
August 2, 2023
About the book (from the publisher)
This book offers a comprehensive framework for mastering the complexities of learning high-dimensional sparse graphical models through the use of conditional independence tests. These tests are strategically conducted within a Markov neighborhood, ensuring both the low dimensionality of the conditioning set and their equivalence to the original high-dimensional conditional independence tests. One notable feature of the methods outlined in this book is their inherent parallel structure for performing conditional independence tests. This enables significant computational acceleration when executed on a multi-core computer or a parallel architecture. This book is intended for researchers, scientists and graduate students in various data science disciplines.
Faming Liang is a Distinguished Professor of Statistics at Purdue University. He is an American Statistical Association fellow, an Institute of Mathematical Statistics fellow and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute. His research interests include machine learning, high-dimensional and big data statistics, Markov chain Monte Carlo, as well as interdisciplinary research in the fields of biomedical sciences and engineering. Currently, he serves as the co-editor for the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.","[{'summary_text': 'this book offers a framework for mastering the complexities of learning high-dimensional sparse graphical models . tests are strategically conducted within a Markov neighborhood, ensuring both the low dimensionality of the conditioning set and their equivalence .'}]"

Researchers look to the human eye to boost computer vision efficiency,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Conventional silicon architecture has taken computer vision a long way, but Purdue University researchers are developing an alternative path — taking a cue from nature — that they say is the foundation of an artificial retina. Like our own visual system, the device is geared to sense change, making it more efficient in principle than the computationally demanding digital camera systems used in applications like self-driving cars and autonomous robots.
“Computer vision systems use a huge amount of energy, and that’s a bottleneck to using them widely. Our long-term goal is to use biomimicry to tackle the challenge of dynamic imaging with less data processing,” said Jianguo Mei, the Richard and Judith Wien Professor of Chemistry in Purdue’s College of Science. “By mimicking our retina in terms of light perception, our system can be potentially much less data intensive, though there is a long way ahead to integrate hardware with software to make it become a reality.”
Mei and his team drew their inspiration from light perception in retinal cells. As in nature, light triggers an electrochemical reaction in the prototype device they have built. The reaction strengthens steadily and incrementally with repeated exposure to light and dissipates slowly when light is withdrawn, creating what is effectively a memory of the light information the device received. That memory could potentially be used to reduce the amount of data that must be processed to understand a moving scene, an approach that is more energy and computationally efficient and error tolerant than conventional computer vision.
The team calls their device an organic electrochemical photonic synapse and say that it more closely mimics how the human visual system works and has greater potential as the foundation of a device for human-machine interfaces. The design may also be useful for neuromorphic computing applications that operate on principles similar to the architecture of the human brain, said Ke Chen, a graduate student in Mei’s lab and lead author of a Nature Photonics paper that tested the device on facial recognition.
“In a normal computer vision system, you create a signal, then you have to transfer the data from memory to processing and back to memory; it takes a lot of time and energy to do that,” Chen said. “Our device has integrated functions of light perception, light to electric signal transformation, and on-site memory and data processing.”
Currently, robotic or autonomous devices rely on the familiar digital camera as the foundation of computer vision. Inside the camera, light-sensitive areas of crystal silicon, called photosites, absorb photons and release electrons, converting light to an electrical signal that can be processed with increasingly sophisticated computer image recognition programs. A typical smartphone camera uses upwards of 10 million photosites, each only a few microns (one millionth of a meter) square, capturing images with far higher resolution than our own eyes can do.
But all that data — having to analyze all available light information regardless of whether the scene changes or not — isn’t necessary to many of the tasks that use computer vision. By contrast, Mei’s solution, like human vision, is relatively low resolution but is well suited to sensing movement. Human eyes have a resolution in the neighborhood of 15 microns. The prototype device — which houses 18,000 transistors on a 10-centimeter square chip — has a resolution of a few hundred microns, and Mei said the technology could be improved by lowering resolution to about 10 microns.
“Our eye and brain aren’t as high resolution as silicon computing, but the way we process the data makes our eye better than most of the imaging systems we have right now when it comes to dealing with data,” Mei said. “Computer vision systems deal with a humongous amount of data because the digital camera doesn’t differentiate between what is static and what is dynamic, it just captures everything.”
Rather than going straight from light to an electrical signal, Mei and his team first convert light to a flow of charged atoms called ions, a mechanism similar to that which retinal cells use to transmit light inputs to the brain. They do this with a small square of a light-sensitive polymer embedded in an electrolyte gel. Light hitting a spot on the polymer square attracts positively charged ions in the gel to the spot (and repels negatively charged ions) creating a charge imbalance in the gel.
Repeated exposure to light increases the charge imbalance in the gel, a feature which can be used to differentiate between the consistent light of a static scene and the dynamic light of a changing scene. When the light is removed, the ions remain in their charged configuration for a short period of time in what can be considered a temporary memory of light, gradually returning to a neutral configuration.
The positively charged spot serves as the gate on a transistor, allowing a small electric current to flow between a source and a drain in the presence of light. Much like the conventional photodetector, the electric current is indicative of light intensity and wavelength, and is passed to a computer for image recognition. But while the output of an electric current is the same, it is the intermediate step of converting light to the electrochemical signal that creates motion sensing and memory capabilities.
Mei’s electrochemical transistor is one of an emerging class of optoelectronic devices that seek to integrate light perception and memory, but the performance of their device is superior in that the charge imbalance increases in smooth and steady increments with repeated exposure to light and decays more slowly than competing designs. With plans for future iterations to be made of a flexible material, they may also be able to produce a version that is wearable and even bio-compatible.
At Purdue, Mei and Chen are joined in the research by Hang Hu, Inho Song, Won-June Lee and Ashkan Abtahi as well as researchers at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “Artificial Retina Based on Photon-Modulated Electrochemical Doping” was published in Nature Photonics with the support of Ambilight Inc.

Purdue IoT software platform uses gaming to motivate energy-efficient behaviors in residential communities,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
State and municipal housing authorities, housing developers, HVAC vendors and utility providers can strengthen their energy-efficiency programs in residential community service areas with a patent-pending, Internet of Things (IoT) system developed by Purdue University researchers that uses gaming to incentivize users.
Panagiota Karava, professor in the Lyles School of Civil Engineering, leads a multidisciplinary research team that has developed MySmartE, an eco-feedback and gaming platform for residential energy management.
“MySmartE addresses the need to effectively deploy energy-efficiency and decarbonization programs in residential communities that would result in measurable, transferable and sustainable outcomes,” Karava said. “This is accomplished by actively engaging and incentivizing residents in understanding and reducing their home energy use.”
The cloud-based software platform is implemented on user-interactive smart devices. Features include:
Smart thermostat functionality that works like a smart tablet with a voice assistant.
Social games that raise awareness of energy-efficient behaviors.
An algorithm that delivers personalized actionable recommendations.
Novel energy conservation behavior scores.
Karava said the residential sector is responsible for more than 20% of the total energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Various programs have been implemented to improve energy efficiency and to reduce energy consumption in individual households. These include building retrofits, which she said are typically costly, and smart devices like smart thermostats.
“A major advantage of implementing smart devices is that they do not require a large investment in communication infrastructure for data collection and system control,” Karava said.
Smart thermostats have drawbacks, however. Studies report that they are not often used correctly due to difficulties in usability, and there’s a decrease in resident motivation over time.
“One online survey reported that about 40% of programmable-thermostat users did not understand how to program schedules; about 33% maintained a permanent hold mode without using scheduling features,” Karava said. “Similarly, my research team’s experiments with 94 households in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne show that the majority of households used constant set-point temperatures throughout winter and summer; they didn’t utilize any of the thermostats’ smart features.”
The MySmartE web-based software platform uses eco-feedback and social games to engage its users. The platform leverages advances in physics-informed machine learning and human decision-making algorithms.
“Engagement is further accelerated by an intuitive user interface for efficient thermostat control and modularized software infrastructure,” Karava said. “The infrastructure is scalable and flexible to support multiple deployments across diverse housing stock, population demographics and energy programs.”
MySmartE achieved more than 80% residential engagement and 30% energy-use reduction when deployed in more than 130 households across four Indiana cities: Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, South Bend and New Albany.
“Also, our extensive interviews with residents revealed that gamification in MySmartE turns the energy-saving process into a fun and enjoyable activity while increasing energy awareness,” Karava said.
The research team received a $400,000 supplement from the National Science Foundation to further its work; the award builds on an initial $3.5 million award in 2018.
The MySmartE team includes:
Ilias Bilionis, associate professor of mechanical engineering, College of Engineering.
James Braun, director, Center for High Performance Buildings; the Herrick Professor of Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering; professor of civil engineering; courtesy appointment in Environmental and Ecological Engineering, College of Engineering.

"Purdue increases funding, expands programs devoted to campus mental health and wellness services for students, staff, faculty","summarize:Purdue University continues to place greater emphasis on the mental health and well-being of its students, staff and faculty, creating and expanding services and programs while committing significant financial resources to foster a campuswide culture of safety and wellness.
Sparked by recommendations from the Action Council on Student Housing and Well-Being, Purdue is making the following commitments while advancing the university’s new “one-team” approach in fostering deeper and stronger collaborations between key campus units:
Additional financial and human resources have been committed to expand campus mental and well-being services, led by Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), to address the growing needs of students as they pursue academic success and personal growth in this formative time of their lives.
The offices of the Treasurer and the Provost have approved additional funding to expand support for students with disabilities. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) has added three access consultants, and Purdue Testing Services (PTS) has an additional staff member to improve accommodated testing support to faculty. A faculty accommodation consultant role also has been established within the Center for Instructional Excellence to assist faculty.
With sponsor support from the Office of the Provost, the Purdue Graduate Student Government hosted a Mental Health Action Week this fall, and the Purdue Student Government and PGSG each will host Mental Health Action Weeks in the spring.
Purdue teams from Administrative Operations, PSG and PGSG are coming together in collaboration with CityBus to study transportation options on and around campus.
“An investment in the mental health of our students is an investment in the future of Purdue,” says Patrick Wolfe, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity, and co-chair of the Action Council on Student Housing and Well-Being. “As a community of care, we all play an important role in supporting the holistic well-being and wellness of our students.”
Largely through the resources provided by CAPS, Purdue’s 2023-24 appropriation for mental health services has been increased by 27% from the previous year to $4.7 million. That amounts to an additional $1 million annual investment specifically for mental health and well-being services for the campus community.
“CAPS has enhanced resources, increased staffing, added flexible and accessible services, and expanded its campus-based prevention programming and partnerships,” says Beth McCuskey, vice provost for student life. “Our stepped-up model is being implemented to meet the continuum of care on our campus.”
In addition to an enhanced ability to be more responsive in offering 24/7 access to crisis services, the commitment through this additional financial investment means CAPS is 100% staffed for the first time in several years — giving the team greater capacity to respond to an evolving list of mental health and wellness needs ranging from anxiety, depression and academic struggles to eating issues, alcohol use and relationship concerns.
Through additional CAPS staff members, its staff-to-student ratio has been improved significantly, aligning with what is recommended by the International Accreditation of Counseling Services. CAPS, meantime, has doubled the size of its high-risk team the past three years while adding a psychiatric provider and nurse as part of its expanded staffing capacity.
Seeing a significant demand for its services, CAPS served more than 3,400 students during the 2022-23 school year. While down from the year prior, that figure represented an 18% jump from the 2,889 students served by CAPS in 2020-21.
During the 2022-23 academic year, Purdue students attended nearly 19,000 appointments through CAPS related to their mental health and well-being. Overall demand, meanwhile, reached 25,191 appointments requested — a figure that was up 10% from the 2020-21 period.
CAPS currently ranks among the top 4% of universities nationally for unique students served. At the same time, CAPS clients’ average change on what’s termed as an “Overall Distress” scale was in the 95th percentile compared with national benchmarks.
“We are committed to communicate to the Purdue community the availability of these resources as well collectively pledging to break down the stigma that often exists in making use of these resources for the betterment of the mental health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff,” McCuskey says.

Over the last 10 years, McCuskey says Purdue has seen a steady rise in the number of students requiring accommodations, reflecting a national trend. This growth not only underscores the diversity of the Purdue student body, but also highlights the importance of adapting support systems to meet the evolving needs of students.
To directly address this trend and reinforce a commitment to student wellness, the Office of the Provost and Office of the Treasurer have collaborated to approve funding to expand services for students with disabilities:
A new faculty accommodation consultant in the Center for Instructional Excellence will be hired, a move endorsed by the DRC Faculty Advisory Committee and University Senate leaders. Once the position is in place, DRC course accessibility letters will include a direct link to the faculty accommodation consultant for 1:1 support.
The DRC received funding for three new access consultants; Purdue Testing Services received funding for an accommodated testing staff member.
“By investing in these new staff lines, Purdue aims to enhance the overall learning experience for our students and alleviate some of the challenges faced by instructors in meeting the diverse needs of their classrooms,” says Jenna Rickus, vice provost for teaching and learning and the John Martinson Honors College. “Beyond improving student success, this initiative contributes to the ongoing development of a supportive and inclusive academic environment.”
This investment is more than just an increase in personnel, however, Rickus says.
“It is a strategic move to augment our capacity to provide support services. The additional staff will be embedded in Purdue Testing Services, the Disability Resource Center and the Center for Instructional Excellence,” Rickus says. “Through this collaboration, Purdue is creating a more efficient and responsive support system that benefits all stakeholders in the accommodations process.”
Responding to a Giant Leaps Housing and Dining Master Plan recommendation from the Action Council, Purdue trustees also have approved construction of an eight-story residence hall south of Hillenbrand Residence Hall to provide more opportunities for an integrated student life experience aimed at enhancing student success and wellness. Trustees also approved the renovation and expansion of Hillenbrand’s existing dining area from 500 seats to 800 seats.
Feedback and ideas are welcomed about how to work together on behalf of students, staff and faculty to meet the growing demand for mental health services and to be better equipped and responsive to this growing need not just on campus but also in our broader community.
“While we believe we are making these investments for all the right reasons, we acknowledge more can and will be done,” says Chris Ruhl, chief financial officer and treasurer, and co-chair of the Action Council on Student Housing and Well-Being.
We listened and responded to our campus by expanding the resources and support systems that address your physical and mental health and well-being.

"Purdue laser innovations unleash precision, potential in laser-material interactions","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Industrial manufacturers and academic researchers can use patented, innovative laser techniques developed at Purdue University to produce high-tech materials such as semiconductor oxide thin films and metals with high performance under extreme conditions and conduct ultrafine-scale manipulation of physical properties in nanomaterials.
Gary Cheng has created innovations that improve upon traditional techniques of laser shock peening, nanowire shaping and transparent film processing. He is a professor in the School of Industrial Engineering and has a courtesy appointment in the School of Materials Engineering.
The innovations have been tested and validated, and the results have been published in peer-reviewed journals including Advanced Materials, Materials Today, Matter, Nature Communications, Science and Science Advances.
Cheng and his colleagues have invented a laser-based nanomanufacturing platform to achieve ultrafine-scale (down to sub-5 nanometers), 3D manipulation of metals and nanomaterials. The platform enables precise patterning, integration and strain-engineering.
It has led to applications such as opening a large band gap in graphene and fine-tuning the spacing between 2D materials and quantum dots, nanowires and nanodiamonds. There are applications in plasmonics, sensing, quantum information and nanophononics.
“Using a laser to manipulate the force and temperature on nanomaterials at an ultrafine scale creates opportunities for 3D micro/nano-component manufacturing, including patterning and integration of 0D-2D heterostructured nanomaterials,” Cheng said. “This generates opportunities for developing new generations of miniature devices in fields like semiconductors, nanoelectronics and quantum technology.”
Cheng’s laser-based processing of thin films and nanomaterial inks addresses challenges in microstructure, defects, residual stress control and performance stability for thin film. It offers scalable manufacturing for high-performance and reliable optoelectronics and photovoltaics.
Large consumer devices like flat-panel displays, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells depend on transparent conducting oxide, or TCO, films. Oxide semiconductors also have been used for thin-film transistors in next-generation devices such as high-resolution liquid crystal displays, organic light-emitting diode displays and flexible electronics.
“The traditional material to create TCO films has been indium tin oxide,” Cheng said. “Currently, semiconductor oxides such as gallium-doped zinc oxides and gallium-doped tin oxides are under research and development to replace it. Physical vapor deposition manufactures these thin films with high electron conductivity, however, their performance cannot meet the commercial criteria in performance and high-rate production.”
Cheng and his colleagues have manufactured semiconductor oxide thin films by combining pulsed laser deposition with laser annealing to achieve better structural and optoelectronic properties than traditionally manufactured films. To realize large-scale thin-film device manufacturing, his team also combined roll-to-roll printing of nano-inks with laser annealing for high-quality crystalline low-defect thin film, to deposit nanolayers from nanoparticles, nanowires and 2D materials like graphene and molybdenum disulfide.
“This method achieved superior performance compared with traditional deposition techniques, especially when various materials need to be deposited sequentially, making it attractive for large-scale manufacturing,” Cheng said. “There are potential applications with various nanomaterials and other deposition methods such as sol-gel printing and spray coating.”
Traditional laser shock peening, or LSP, works the surface of a metal to improve its material properties like resistance to fatigue and corrosion. The surface is confined by a glass or liquid barrier and then exposed to short laser pulses. The pulses create a shockwave that travels into the metal to deform the surface at an ultrahigh strain rate, which generates beneficial microstructure and residual stress.
Cheng said traditional LSP has drawbacks.
“Traditionally the microstructure and residual stresses are not stable after long fatigue cycles, especially under extreme conditions,” Cheng said. “In addition, traditional LSP has a challenge to treat high-strength metals using water as confinement.”
Cheng’s innovation, called nanostructure-integrated laser shock peening, or nLSP, controls the temperature during the process to introduce nanostructures such as ultrafine and high-density nanoscale phases and dislocations. These nanostructures stabilize the beneficial microstructure and residual stress. His research has applications in the aerospace and naval industries to address the reliability of materials under extreme conditions.
“Using the method, we have shown the efficiency of nLSP on aluminum and titanium alloys with much faster processing speed and stronger shock pressure, while nanostructures can also be introduced to enhance the metals’ mechanical properties and stability,” he said.
Cheng has received financial support to conduct his research from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Research Council, National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research and Purdue Office of Research.
Cheng disclosed these laser-related innovations to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for and received patents to protect the intellectual property.

Combined microbiome datasets yield accurate prediction of animal ages,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
An analysis combining the results of 14 studies from around the globe has uncovered some common patterns in how the piglet microbiome, specifically the gut bacteria, changes over time.
“There are exceptions, but overall, we found general trends between all those animals,” said Tim Johnson, associate professor in the College of Agriculture’s Department of Animal Sciences at Purdue University. “We think these patterns are widely applicable because our dataset came from multiple studies around the world, and when we tested the predictions in unrelated datasets, the patterns held.”
Johnson and three co-authors published their analysis in the journal Microbiology Spectrum. Although studies like this one are fairly common in the human microbiome field, relatively few have focused on animal microbiomes. “We’re trying to bring the animal side up to speed with the human side,” Johnson said.
The study comes as the $54 billion pig industry works under pressure to create a high-quality, economically important, nutritious product while also lowering its environmental impact and using fewer antibiotics to keep the animals healthy.
“There’s hope that by controlling the microbiome, we’ll be able to make some of the gains that need to be made in production and environmental impact,” he said. “This field is just beginning. A study like this one lays a lot of foundation work, which was missing up to this point.”
The analysis incorporated data from studies published between 2019 and 2021 that were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, the Netherlands, Norway and the U.S. The data spanned more than 3,300 fecal microbial communities sampled from about 350 pigs over 60 time points ranging from birth to market age.
Co-author Nicole Ricker from the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph in Canada co-led one of the studies included in the analysis, published in 2020 in Frontiers in Veterinary Science. Ricker, an assistant professor in the Department of Pathobiology, highlighted two key findings in the work that provide a foundation for future studies.
“First, the overall trajectory of the microbiome development through piglet development is predictable and can be modeled effectively, despite methodological differences in the studies examined,” Ricker said. The animals involved in the studies consisted of various breeds differing in genetics and that ate different diets.
Second, the research revealed important details of the piglet microbiome at a fine time scale. “This opens a diversity of research avenues for understanding how piglet microbiome development is impacted by different management strategies including feed additives, weaning time and antibiotic use,” she said.
One goal of the study was to predict the age of the animals based on their microbiomes. The researchers were able to do so with an accuracy of about 70%. Evidence has suggested that a more mature microbial community becomes stable more quickly. That might then translate into more consistent growth conditions for the animal.
“That’s important because the microbial community plays a major role in influencing the animals’ immune system, health, how well they digest their feed and how quickly they grow,” Johnson said.
The researchers found that the bacterial community in the piglets did change over time, but the rate of change slowed. “The most surprising part for me is we were able to find that specific bacteria that are important to the succession or the maturity of the community were similar between all the different study locations,” he said.
The new analysis also highlighted the value of more frequent microbiome sampling. Many studies took samples once a week. Others gave a treatment for several weeks, then took a sample at the end to see what had happened.
With the dataset that Johnson and his colleagues have assembled, researchers can compare how treatments affect normal animals. Although previous studies have also done this, they relied on single datasets that compared treated to untreated animals.
“In an individual study, control animals may not actually represent a global average of a normal microbiota. The controls may deviate from a more global average,” Johnson said. The combined dataset allows researchers to compare the global average to local studies.
The global average size and variety of the gut bacteria populations varied in an oscillating pattern that showed a general increase in diversity over time. Sampling a treatment group during a big swing in the microbiota population could provide misleading results.
“It is possible that the difference that you see between treatment group microbiomes is during one of these temporary changes rather than the general trend,” Johnson said. “We want to encourage people to sample multiple time points so that you make sure you’re on a general trend and not in some temporary swing.”
Lead author Wenxuan Dong is a recent Master of Science graduate of Johnson’s lab, and Devin Holman of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada also contributed to this research.","[{'summary_text': 'an analysis combining the results of 14 studies from around the globe has uncovered some common patterns in how the piglet microbiome changes over time . the study comes as the $54 billion pig industry works under pressure to create a high-quality, economically important, nutritious product .'}]"

Study: Hair care product chemicals can linger in the air in surprising amounts,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The average morning routine for many Americans includes inhaling several milligrams of chemicals that may be harmful to their health, Purdue University researchers have found.
In a newly published paper in Environmental Science & Technology, a journal of the American Chemical Society, Nusrat Jung, an assistant professor in the Lyles School of Civil Engineering, discovered that several chemicals, particularly cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes — which are ubiquitous in hair care products — linger in the air after use. On average, Jung’s team reports, a person can inhale a cumulative mass of 1-17 milligrams of potentially harmful chemicals in a single hair care session in their home.
“We found the results to be extremely alarming,” Jung said. “We did not expect to see such significant emissions of volatile chemical mixtures from off-the-shelf hair care products during typical hair care routines that many people perform each and every day.

"Purdue Global faculty member summits Mount Kilimanjaro, inspiring others to complete their own journeys","summarize:After earning her PhD and climbing nearly 18,000 feet at Mount Everest in 2018, Heather Sager was eager for the next adventure. However, a new job and a global pandemic delayed those dreams.
Fast-forward to October 2023, and Sager, now an adjunct faculty member in Purdue Global’s College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, set out to celebrate her birthday by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in October.
Before summiting Africa’s highest peak, Sager, along with her friend Zakiya Vallier, endured nine months of grueling, disciplined training.
“It was kind of a part-time job in itself, but it led to other changes in my life that were healthy and positive,” Sager said. “It was hard for me to say no to chocolate, but it made me really focus on eating healthier and overall holistic health.”
The feat was worth it and provided an opportunity to inspire her students who are “climbing their own mountains” toward earning their degree.
“When I was struggling on Day 2 of the climb, we had a guide who encouraged me to not think about the next amount of days but just focus on right now,” she said. “Take the next step, and then just do that over and over and over.”
Sager drew inspiration from her students, pushing through the challenging times herself by remembering many of the obstacles her own students have faced to reach their goals.
“Students have shared with me some of their struggles — housing, food insecurity, custody battles, unemployment — and they’re just doing so many hard things,” she said. “They just keep plugging along toward completing their degree. It has been very moving and inspiring to me, so I just wanted to channel that along my journey.”
Sager says she came away from this experience grateful and hopes that everyone can show more kindness and gratefulness.
“I wanted to represent Purdue Global,” she said. “I’ve loved my experience teaching here, so I wanted to help inspire my students who have also inspired me.”","[{'summary_text': 'after earning her PhD and climbing nearly 18,000 feet at Mount Everest in 2018, Heather Sager set out to celebrate her birthday by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in October . she endured nine months of grueling, disciplined training .'}]"

When Lakshay Vohra makes a presentation to his clients, he does so with confidence. A 2022 graduate of the Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Management (MSBAIM) program in the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, Vohra learned a service mindset while making class presentations in his industry practicum course.
“I had to know … what is the professor expecting?” says Vohra, now a data scientist with Boston Consulting Group in San Francisco. “That same standard is aligned with consulting. Now, what does the client expect? My experience at Purdue was great preparation for what I face in my job every day.”
That’s music to the ears of Matthew Lanham, MSBAIM’s academic director. He takes pride in the program’s No. 6 U.S. standing in QS World University Rankings for 2023 and credits a mixture of classroom learning and experiential opportunities for its success.
“We try to replicate what our students will face as they begin their careers,” Lanham says. “The program is intense, with 36 credit hours in the span of one year. We continuously update our curriculum, including new cloud computing courses and a visual analytics offering. We also provide a professional portfolio course during summer session that better prepares our students for their careers.”

Students can earn certifications (e.g., Microsoft AZ-900, AWS Cloud Practitioner, Tableau Desktop Associate), and all will graduate as associate certified analytics professionals. They compete in events such as the national Data 4 Good Case Competition, which offers $45,000 in prize money, and present research at events such as the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) Business Analytics Conference.
Purdue also encourages students in the program to compete in its Future Edelman Impact Award contest, which gives them the chance to solve challenges in a team setting and mirrors the nationally recognized Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Advanced Analytics, Operations Research and Management Science, which is administered by INFORMS. Vohra was part of a finalist team in the campus competition as a student.
Lanham says the combination of teaching and learning by doing is paying off for graduates of the program. The Class of 2022, which includes Vohra, saw 99% placement with an average starting salary of more than $124,000. This year’s class numbers are still being assembled, but the salaries again will exceed $110,000 with placement of at least 97%.
Several alumni of the program are progressing in their companies. One, Deepika Jindal (MSBAIM ’19), has received a patent for work she has done as a data scientist at Amazon.
Vohra says the Daniels School experiences, including relevant coursework, equipped him with the knowledge to effectively deploy informational technologies and analytical techniques and communicate those findings concisely and professionally.
He gives particular credit to a business analytics course taught by Mohit Tawarmalani, a data mining course by Wei Sun, and Lanham’s industry practicum offering as being most helpful to him in his daily work.
“The experiences I had at Purdue gave me more than a resume,” says Vohra, who does much of his work for Boston Consulting Group in the agriculture space. “They gave me a story I could tell recruiters and something that set me apart from other applicants.”","[{'summary_text': 'lakshay Vohra is a 2022 graduate of the Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Management (MSBAIM) program in the Mitchell E.

Purdue students’ international education opportunities abound abroad,"summarize:When it comes to study abroad opportunities, Purdue students have no shortage of choices. From adventurous spring break study tours and semester-long sessions to immersive internships and cooperative education programs, Purdue offers Boilermakers hundreds of unique ways to embark on fulfilling experiences while broadening the horizons of their knowledge.
Each year, approximately 2,000 students participate through their choice of more than 400 Purdue-approved study abroad programs in over 60 countries, including those who take part in additional programs organized by colleges and departments across campus. These experiences, ranging anywhere from one week to one year, help students like Booth Kayonga, a senior majoring in political science, gain global perspectives and open doors for future academic opportunities.
“I think studying abroad really helped reformulate the way I think about the world around me,” Kayonga says. “The quality of education I received was fantastic, and it aided in my understanding of international politics and really had me questioning my own political beliefs. I was able to look at my own thoughts and critically analyze them in a way I never could before because I was just kind of in this bubble in the States.”
Though the thought of being alone in a new environment initially intimidated Kayonga, she took the leap and spent the duration of her yearlong exchange program pursuing coursework focused on international relations at the University of Bristol in England. There, she immersed herself in topics she wouldn’t have otherwise had the opportunity to study and formed bonds with her peers, lecturers and professors.
Now a Purdue Study Abroad peer advisor, Kayonga shares her experience with other students as she guides them through the first stages of the study abroad process, easing their nerves along the way. Her time in Bristol, along with the communication, problem-solving and collaboration skills she gained before, during and after her program, played a key part in her decision to apply for graduate programs at home and overseas.
“I feel like my experience abroad has really helped me feel more confident that I will be able to successfully complete graduate studies,” Kayonga says. “It’s not just the study abroad experience itself. The skills that I gained and the problems I had to solve during the process aided in making me a well-rounded student and competitive candidate.”
Purdue’s international education offerings also extend beyond traditional study abroad journeys. Administered by the Office of Professional Practice, the Global Engineering Alliance for Research and Education (GEARE) is an international work experience program that integrates language coursework, study abroad, cultural training, domestic and international work, and research experience and global design team projects into the College of Engineering curriculum.
More than 400 students are currently enrolled in GEARE, including Catherine Bradley, whose interest in the program first formed as a high school senior on a tour of Purdue’s campus. Now a senior majoring in chemical engineering and president of GEARE Ambassadors, Bradley says joining the program has been a highlight of her Purdue journey.
“I’ve never been in a student organization that gives so much freedom to go out and try new things and grow the program in the way that GEARE has. Whatever you want out of your experience at Purdue — whether it’s research experience or learning more about other cultures — you can find that within GEARE, and there are resources here to help you.”
Bradley’s involvement with GEARE led her to spend a semester of her junior year studying at Universidad San Francisco de Quito in Ecuador, where she soaked in coursework delivered entirely in Spanish. Her months abroad were filled with weekend trips visiting research facilities, scuba diving in the Galapagos Islands and exploring the city.
After her spring semester abroad, Bradley embarked on a second endeavor during the summer — this time in Bogota, Colombia — where she conducted nanoparticle research at Universidad del Rosario and absorbed the many ways universities collaborate to foster innovation.
Bradley knows the interpersonal and leadership skills she’s gained during her time with the program will serve her well in the future when she continues her pursuit of higher education and looks toward a career in defense.
“It’s given me confidence in myself,” Bradley says. “It’s a hard thing to go abroad like that, and now coming back and having done it, I’ve realized I can do a whole lot more than I thought I could. I know that will make me more successful when I talk to people about my research, when I work with people and, even beyond that, when I begin my job search.”

"Arizona company acquires patented, soy-based concrete protectant developed in Indiana","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., and INDIANAPOLIS —
Crafco Inc., an Arizona-based supplier of packaged pavement preservation solutions, has acquired PoreShield, a patented, soy-based protectant that extends the service life of concrete.
PoreShield was created through a research collaboration among Purdue University, the Indiana Soybean Alliance (ISA) and the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), funded by soybean checkoff dollars.
PoreShield’s key ingredient is soy methyl ester-polystyrene, or SME-PS, which is derived from U.S. soybeans. PoreShield is safe, environmentally friendly and easy to apply, requiring no additional personal protective equipment.
Paul Imbrock, a member of the original research team that created PoreShield, is now a technical lead at Crafco.
“INDOT was experiencing premature saw-cut pavement joint deterioration,” he said. “The saw cuts on concrete highways tend to hold water, and deicing salts often are the limiting factor in the service life of concrete pavements. Repairing just the saw-cut joints in concrete pavements is costly and requires closing to traffic or otherwise maintaining traffic patterns for the construction zone.”
Bernard Tao, professor emeritus of agricultural and biological engineering and food science, and Jason Weiss, former Purdue professor of civil engineering, had the idea to try SME-PS for preserving pavement joints. The ISA became a partner to provide material sources and aid in further research and development.
When Imbrock began in Weiss’ laboratory, SME-PS already had been working well in laboratory tests. Imbrock established field trials and further testing with INDOT.
“When I left Purdue, I started a company to license the intellectual property that was jointly held by Purdue and the ISA. The license was issued by the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization,” Imbrock said. “The road to implementation with INDOT was a long one. Ultimately, I moved to a role as a consultant for ISA helping with market development and supporting additional licensees. This is when SME-PS became PoreShield and was marketed as a product rather than a generalized technology.”
Imbrock said ISA was instrumental in bringing PoreShield into the world by continuing to support university research, as well as market development work through trade shows, conferences and direct meetings with industry and INDOT.
In 2019, INDOT applied PoreShield on sections of U.S. 24, Interstate 69 and Interstate 65. INDOT saved money and reduced labor costs compared to the products and practices it replaced. The estimates are a 20% percent savings from application on joint treatments and a 25%-35% savings from surface treatments, such as on bridges.
“You’ve invested millions in a concrete highway, it’s something you want to last for at least two decades, and PoreShield has been proven to extend the life of concrete,” Imbrock said.
State departments of transportation in Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin have conducted real-world testing of PoreShield and adopted it for use in road projects. PoreShield has been applied on patios and walkways at universities including Purdue, the sidewalks of a fire station and hundreds of residential driveways. It can be applied in other construction and architectural projects including parking lots and garages, curbing, buildings, dams and pipelines.
Gary Johnson, president, Crafco: “Innovation has long been a strategic imperative at Crafco, so we appreciate the extensive research and development invested in PoreShield. We are pleased to welcome this inventive product into our lineup because we believe it will become the new standard in concrete preservation.”
Lisa Zentner, vice president of specialty products, Crafco: “PoreShield represents the next generation of pavement preservation products: safer, easier to use and more effective. With this acquisition, Crafco is poised to enter new markets, helping reduce the burden of preserving concrete in a variety of applications. PoreShield is truly the future of concrete preservation.”
Courtney Kingery, CEO, Indiana Soybean Alliance: “Crafco is a great partner to take PoreShield to the next level, and I can’t wait to see all they are able to accomplish. So many people had a hand in getting PoreShield to this point. Everyone should be proud of their work.”
Mike Koehne, board chair, Indiana Soybean Alliance, and farmer from Greensburg, Indiana: “This is exciting news for soybean growers everywhere, but especially for those of us from Indiana who invested checkoff dollars into the research and development of this product. Soybeans have always been a versatile crop that can provide many inexpensive products that help the world, and PoreShield is another product realizing its potential. Not only that, it creates new markets for soybeans.”

Purdue’s October Consumer Food Insights Report, which focused on food costs and consumer trends around the holidays, measured food price inflation at 3.7% this past month, the lowest reading in two years. Joseph Balagtas, a professor in the College of Agriculture’s Department of Agricultural Economics and director of the Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability at Purdue University, says that although inflation is cooling, prices are still 3.7% higher than last year and 15% higher than two years ago. Due largely to the lower price of turkey, the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner will be about 9% lower than the cost last year.

To live on the moon or Mars, humans will need heat and air conditioning that can operate long term in reduced gravity and temperatures hundreds of degrees above or below what we experience on Earth. Building these systems requires knowing how reduced gravity affects boiling and condensation, which all heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems use to operate in Earth’s gravity. A Purdue University experiment that arrived Aug. 4 to the International Space Station aims to collect data scientists need to answer decades-old questions about how boiling and condensation work in reduced gravity.

Purdue reminds agricultural employers of their responsibilities when hiring youth workers,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Harvest is a busy time of year for Indiana farmers. Recent injury incidents involving youth and inexperienced workers highlight the potentially hazardous events that can be paired with the season. Bill Field, Purdue University professor of agricultural and biological engineering, reminds agricultural employers, regardless of the size of the operation, to be mindful of both their responsibilities and liabilities when hiring young workers.
“Deaths and injuries to youth who participate in potentially hazardous activities as part of their agriculture-related employment represent a needless loss and reflect poorly upon the agricultural community. No crop is worth the life of a young worker,” Field said.
Regulations that specifically address agriculture are included as the Hazardous Occupations Order in Agriculture (HOOAs), an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938. The HOOAs specify agriculture tasks that can and cannot be legally performed for hire by a youth younger than age 16.
Prohibited tasks were determined by the U.S. secretary of labor to be especially dangerous for this population based on prior injury data. These activities include operating tractors over 20 horsepower, operating certain machinery such as forklifts, entering confined spaces, handling pesticides, operating buses or automobiles to transport passengers, using blasting agents, and handling anhydrous ammonia.
Since these regulations are over five decades old, they do not specifically mention some hazards currently found in agricultural production such as the operation of all-terrain vehicles, utility vehicles and skid-steer loaders.
Failure to adhere to the HOOAs can result in incidents such as flowing grain engulfment that recently claimed the lives of several young workers. The HOOAs prohibit youth younger than age 16 from working as an employee inside fruit, forage or grain storage facilities designed to retain an oxygen deficient or toxic atmosphere.
Penalties for violations of the HOOAs can include “a civil penalty, not to exceed $11,000 for each employee who was the subject of such a violation; or $50,000 with regard to a violation that causes the death or serious injury of an employee under the age of 18 years, which may be doubled when the violation is repeated or willful.”
Farms with more than ten employees of any age are also subject to the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Depending on the level or frequency of negligence determined, OSHA reserves the right to refer the incident to the U.S. Justice Department for criminal investigation.
“Recognizing that younger employees are more vulnerable to workplace injuries, and adhering to regulations designed to promote the safety of employees, will reduce or eliminate the potential for injuries and deaths while affording greater protection from civil liability,” Field said.
For more information on the employment of youth in agriculture, contact your local Wage and Hour office, Department of Labor, or visit www.osha.gov. Another source for training resources for young and beginning workers is www.agsafety4youth.info.","[{'summary_text': 'recent injury incidents involving youth and inexperienced workers highlight the potentially hazardous events . employers should be mindful of both their responsibilities and liabilities when hiring young workers .

The mind’s eye of a neural network system,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
In the background of image recognition software that can ID our friends on social media and wildflowers in our yard are neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence inspired by how own our brains process data. While neural networks sprint through data, their architecture makes it difficult to trace the origin of errors that are obvious to humans — like confusing a Converse high-top with an ankle boot — limiting their use in more vital work like health care image analysis or research. A new tool developed at Purdue University makes finding those errors as simple as spotting mountaintops from an airplane.
“In a sense, if a neural network were able to speak, we’re showing you what it would be trying to say,” said David Gleich, a Purdue professor of computer science in the College of Science who developed the tool, which is featured in a paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence. “The tool we’ve developed helps you find places where the network is saying, ‘Hey, I need more information to do what you’ve asked.’ I would advise people to use this tool on any high-stakes neural network decision scenarios or image prediction task.”
Code for the tool is available on GitHub, as are use case demonstrations. Gleich collaborated on the research with Tamal K. Dey, also a Purdue professor of computer science, and Meng Liu, a former Purdue graduate student who earned a doctorate in computer science.
In testing their approach, Gleich’s team caught neural networks mistaking the identity of images in databases of everything from chest X-rays and gene sequences to apparel. In one example, a neural network repeatedly mislabeled images of cars from the Imagenette database as cassette players. The reason? The pictures were drawn from online sales listings and included tags for the cars’ stereo equipment.
Neural network image recognition systems are essentially algorithms that process data in a way that mimics the weighted firing pattern of neurons as an image is analyzed and identified. A system is trained to its task — such as identifying an animal, a garment or a tumor — with a “training set” of images that includes data on each pixel, tagging and other information, and the identity of the image as classified within a particular category. Using the training set, the network learns, or “extracts,” the information it needs in order to match the input values with the category. This information, a string of numbers called an embedded vector, is used to calculate the probability that the image belongs to each of the possible categories. Generally speaking, the correct identity of the image is within the category with the highest probability.
But the embedded vectors and probabilities don’t correlate to a decision-making process that humans would recognize. Feed in 100,000 numbers representing the known data, and the network produces an embedded vector of 128 numbers that don’t correspond to physical features, although they do make it possible for the network to classify the image. In other words, you can’t open the hood on the algorithms of a trained system and follow along. Between the input values and the predicted identity of the image is a proverbial “black box” of unrecognizable numbers across multiple layers.
“The problem with neural networks is that we can’t see inside the machine to understand how it’s making decisions, so how can we know if a neural network is making a characteristic mistake?” Gleich said.
Rather than trying to trace the decision-making path of any single image through the network, Gleich’s approach makes it possible to visualize the relationship that the computer sees among all the images in an entire database. Think of it like a bird’s-eye view of all the images as the neural network has organized them.
The relationship among the images (like network’s prediction of the identity classification of each of the images in the database) is based on the embedded vectors and probabilities the network generates. To boost the resolution of the view and find places where the network can’t distinguish between two different classifications, Gleich’s team first developed a method of splitting and overlapping the classifications to identify where images have a high probability of belonging to more than one classification.
The team then maps the relationships onto a Reeb graph, a tool taken from the field of topological data analysis. On the graph, each group of images the network thinks are related is represented by a single dot. Dots are color coded by classification. The closer the dots, the more similar the network considers groups to be, and most areas of the graph show clusters of dots in a single color. But groups of images with a high probability of belonging to more than one classification will be represented by two differently colored overlapping dots. With a single glance, areas where the network cannot distinguish between two classifications appear as a cluster of dots in one color, accompanied by a smattering of overlapping dots in a second color. Zooming in on the overlapping dots will show an area of confusion, like the picture of the car that’s been labeled both car and cassette player.
“What we’re doing is taking these complicated sets of information coming out of the network and giving people an ‘in’ into how the network sees the data at a macroscopic level,” Gleich said. “The Reeb map represents the important things — the big groups and how they relate to each other — and that makes it possible to see the errors.”
“Topological Structure of Complex Predictions” was produced with the support of the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy.","[{'summary_text': ""a new tool developed at Purdue University makes finding errors as simple as spotting mountaintops from an airplane .

"Fulbright Program opens doors internationally for Purdue scholars, students","summarize:There is no shortage of ways for Purdue students and faculty to transport themselves from a classroom or lab in West Lafayette to an institution of higher learning in a foreign country. But for many, the Fulbright Program was the vehicle that thrust their educational trajectory to the international level.
Both the Fulbright Scholar Program and the Fulbright U.S. Student Program are among the nation’s top educational and cultural exchange systems for students and educators who want to study, teach and conduct research.
International Education Week is Nov. 13-17, and Purdue University was named one of the top producers of Fulbright scholars and students for the 2022-23 academic year. Countries traveled to include Mexico, Cyprus, Germany and Sweden.
Chris Lukasik, Purdue professor of English and American studies, became the provost’s fellow for faculty Fulbright awards after he traveled to the Philippines as a Fulbright scholar and to Austria on a Fulbright specialist grant.
“For faculty, the Fulbright Scholar Program is one of the few prestigious award programs that is open to virtually any field of expertise,” Lukasik says.
Eight faculty members were named Fulbright scholars for 2023-24, including Bethany McGowan, associate professor in Purdue Libraries and School of Information Studies. McGowan’s Fulbright journey brought her to Tampere University in Finland, where she taught a seven-week graduate course on managing information overflow during public health emergencies. She is also using her time abroad on research, examining how elements of Finland’s national literacy strategy could apply to the United States.
“A Fulbright scholar award offers faculty the opportunity to spend significant time abroad, establishing or strengthening collaborations with colleagues from other countries,” McGowan says. “Fulbright commissions, in my case the Fulbright Finland Foundation, do an amazing job of ensuring fellows are well supported and well connected during their visit.”
In 2019, human development and family science professor David Purpura traveled to KU Leuven in Belgium for a Fulbright fellowship that focused on research.
“The connections I made there have stayed with me today and really enhanced how I think about my research and expanded my worldview of educational research,” Purpura says.
Senior undergraduates at Purdue, as well as alumni who earned a bachelor’s or master’s degree from Purdue as their most recent degree, and current Purdue graduate students who will not have completed a PhD prior to the beginning of their grant year, are all eligible for the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. The program provides postbaccalaureate funding to study, research or teach abroad in more than 140 countries.
“The wonderful thing about the Fulbright U.S. Student Program is that one can pursue the time abroad to take place immediately postbac, as a recent alum or during graduate studies. The time abroad can be spent teaching English, conducting research or pursuing degree studies, meaning one can customize their own experience,” says Veronica Schirm, director of the National and International Scholarships Office within the John Martinson Honors College.
For Andrew Santos, his Fulbright experience stemmed from his desire to see more of the world through the lens of physics and French. After graduating from Purdue in 2020 with a bachelor’s degree in physics and minors in business French, mathematics and astronomy, Santos went to the École Polytechnique in Palaiseau, France, to work with a team of scientists who were part of a Nobel Prize-winning physics experiment.
“It was terrifying to move to a different country in the middle of a pandemic to learn and conduct research in a foreign language. It was uncomfortable as much as it was rewarding, though,” Santos says. “Despite all the challenges, I would have never had the chance to speak a language I love while working for a neutrino physics experiment that keeps my curiosity and passions running wild.”
While Purdue has dispatched dozens of students and faculty members around the world on behalf of the Fulbright Program, the university has also welcomed distinguished scholars who were sent to Purdue after becoming Fulbright awardees in their respective home countries.
Natasha Duncan, associate dean for academic and international affairs in the Honors College, heads the selection process for incoming Fulbright scholars to Purdue’s West Lafayette campus. Purdue is currently part of a 10-year partnership with Fulbright Brazil, and it is Duncan’s duty to designate a visiting scholar from Brazil each year.
“I think Purdue benefits in a number of ways, both in terms of research collaborations and the courses that the Fulbright scholars deliver. Many of the visiting scholars are also interested in engaging our students in an extracurricular capacity,” Duncan says.
Duncan worked with the College of Agriculture to select the current Brazilian scholar, Danilo Aguiar, an economics professor from Federal University in São Carlos, Brazil. During his semester in West Lafayette, Aguiar is teaching an interdisciplinary group of students within the Honors College about climate change economics.
He says one of the differences between teaching in Brazil and at Purdue is working with a smaller number of students.
“Since there are fewer students, we can enjoy more discussions, interactions, and you can learn more about each other,” Aguiar says. “When you are treated to 70 students, you can’t even remember the names of all students after the course is done. Here (in West Lafayette) we can have a closer relationship. In Brazil, I teach only to students majoring in economics, while here I have students from many disciplines. That has helped to broaden my perspective on teaching.”
Duncan says it’s been rewarding to see academic partnerships and other collaborations develop from the Fulbright Program, including co-authored articles, the Purdue-Brazil Fulbright Scholar Reception and a weeklong student exchange.
“I think in the original imagination of the program, we expected for there to be cross-pollination during the time the scholar is here, but we’re seeing longer-term results,” Duncan says.
On her time in Finland, McGowan says, “From embassy visits to research talks to giving lectures on American culture, it’s been a unique, wonderful experience.”
Santos says Fulbright has helped shape how he sees the world: “Being a Fulbright student is to approach life from a different angle. It’s to realize that there can be many more dimensions to a worldview. It’s an adventure, an endeavor worth pursuing both personally and professionally.”

"New faculty reporting tool, Elements, implementation update","summarize:The Office of the Provost and Institutional Data Analytics + Assessment (IDA+A) are pleased to share updates regarding the implementation of the university’s new faculty reporting system, Elements.
In May 2022, the Office of the Provost announced Elements was chosen as the university’s new faculty reporting system. Elements is a streamlined tool that will allow faculty and leadership to collect and view data such as research awards, publications, presentations and teaching innovations in one location.
Elements will pull data from multiple university data sources including Sponsored Programs, Banner and Human Resources, along with external publication databases. With this data, faculty will be able to create a comprehensive profile that facilitates collaboration both internally and externally. Use of the tool will reduce manual entry and ultimately save faculty time.
“This central resource will provide a consistent, reliable source of data about faculty productivity and impact, enhance internal and external faculty visibility, promote the reputation of the university, and ease data collection and reporting for several university needs,” says Sunil Prabhakar, vice provost for faculty affairs.
Elements will be available to faculty and staff beginning Jan. 2, 2024. The Office of the Provost highly encourages departments to utilize Elements for annual reviews for the 2023-24 academic year. Elements will not immediately be used for promotion and tenure processes; however, the goal is to incorporate it into promotion and tenure processes in the future.
Faculty and staff can review information about Elements, including detailed FAQs, on the Faculty Affairs website. Self-service training resources will be shared closer to the launch date.","[{'summary_text': 'Elements will allow faculty and leadership to collect and view data such as research awards, publications, presentations and teaching innovations in one location . use of the tool will reduce manual entry and ultimately save faculty time .'}]"

Staff Excellence: Human Resources — Benefits,"summarize:At Purdue University, the pursuit of excellence at scale is a collective endeavor that relies heavily on the efforts of its dedicated and talented staff. From supporting faculty in their groundbreaking research to fostering student success to ensuring the seamless operation of the university’s many functions, staff members play a pivotal role across campus.
Purdue Today is recognizing these efforts with a new “Staff Excellence” series, which begins today with a feature on the Human Resources – Benefits team.
Through every season, Purdue University’s Human Resources – Benefits team is dedicated to providing faculty, staff, students, and spouses and dependents with a suite of benefits they can depend on.
For this team of 26 staff members led by Candace Shaffer, excellence isn’t an aspiration — it’s a standard that they achieve year after year and one that plays a key role in Purdue’s ability to achieve excellence at scale.
“Purdue’s commitment to employees’ overall health and wellness is a priority for the university,” Purdue President Mung Chiang says. “As the rest of the country experiences hikes in health care premiums, our benefits team has helped the university flatten costs for employees, students, spouses and dependents for the past five years while also providing high-quality, easily accessible and cost-effective health and wellness options.”
Purdue employees have the opportunity to select from a wide variety of benefits options each fall during the university’s open enrollment period. Though this may mark the one time each year some employees think about the open enrollment process or their own benefits package, for Shaffer and her team, it’s a year-round affair. When they aren’t executing open enrollment, they’re gathering data from it, sifting through survey suggestions, meeting with vendors, exploring new options for the coming year, drafting a communication plan and working with university leaders to start the process all over again.
Each year, the benefits team serves approximately 25,900 faculty and staff members from Purdue West Lafayette, Purdue Fort Wayne, Purdue Northwest and Purdue Global; 12,000 domestic, international and graduate student staff; and their dependents. Through it all, they process more than 4,000 calls and emails to answer questions or concerns about open enrollment, leaves of absence, worker’s compensation, accommodations, retirement and other benefits offered by the university. Shaffer and her team find pride in assisting individuals in the Purdue community, whether they’re 18-year-olds fresh out of high school or retirees well into their 90s.
“At the end of the day, the reward is really just providing those benefits,” says Shaffer, associate vice president of benefits and payroll. “There are lots of things that happen in a lifetime, and the fact that we’re able to provide a suite of benefits that serves the entire population at every stage of life, while also keeping premiums flat, giving back premium money, saving the university costs and also offering competitive benefits, is pretty incredible.”
Shaffer and her team are also the brains behind the Healthy Boiler Wellness Program, a multifaceted approach to overall well-being that provides benefits-eligible employees and spouses covered on a Purdue health plan the opportunity to earn financial incentives through annual physicals, health risk assessments and more.
The program’s five pillars — behavioral health, financial wellness, physical health, social wellness and work-life integration — form the foundation of employees’ benefits offerings. Each semester, the team works with a variety of units to offer corresponding resources, events and programs, including Healthy Boiler workshops offered through Purdue’s Center for Healthy Living.
Human Resources’ commitment to serving its huge population of individuals in unique ways is reflected in one of Purdue’s most recent accolades. Purdue University was recognized in the 2023 Healthiest Employers of Indiana, an awards program created to honor people-first organizations that prioritize the well-being of their employee population. The award honors Purdue’s commitment to workplace wellness and exceptional health and benefits offerings.
But it also champions the persistence and excellence of Shaffer’s team, whose work pioneering and implementing the university’s host of health and wellness programs, benefits and resources have helped Purdue make a difference in Boilermakers’ approaches to health care and healthy living.

2023 Outstanding Leadership in Globalization Award winners announced; nominations sought for 2024,"summarize:During International Education Week (Nov. 13-17), Purdue’s Office of Global Partnerships and Global Academic Committee are recognizing the four winners of Purdue’s 2023 Outstanding Leadership in Globalization Award.
This year’s faculty winners are Jill Newton, professor of mathematics education in the College of Education, and Yuehwern Yih, director of the LASER PULSE Consortium, director of the Smart Systems and Operations Laboratory and professor of industrial engineering in the College of Engineering. The two staff winners are Gary Burniske, assistant director for program development in International Programs in Agriculture, and Rhonda Von Werder, PAGE and Global Fellows program manager in the College of Engineering.
These university-level awards are given annually to recognize faculty and staff for their dedicated efforts to increase Purdue’s global recognition as a leader in higher education, either comprehensively or within a specific land-grant mission pillar. Globalization in this context is defined as developing, facilitating and sustaining programs and activities — in partnership with universities, agencies and private-sector constituents outside the United States — that further Purdue’s institutional strategic goals embodied in Purdue’s Next Moves. Specifically, the awards recognize exceptional endeavors that involve faculty and/or students from Purdue and international counterparts in learning, discovery and/or engagement.
Supporting her nomination, the College of Education noted how “Dr. Newton weaves globalization throughout her teaching, discovery and engagement, blurring the lines between the domains and capitalizing on opportunities to collaborate with U.S. scholars … and international partners to build global communities, enhance intercultural learning opportunities and explore the impact of these experiences.” Along with Newton’s Maymester in Tanzania program, which has provided more than 200 students with the opportunity to participate in a global experience in Tanzania, her willingness to adapt during COVID-19 by developing the Global Social Justice in Education community to make online connections between Purdue students and international scholars epitomized her commitment to globalization at Purdue.
Yih’s leadership is evident through her work in multiple countries, including South Sudan and Ukraine. In Ukraine alone, her E+TRA system (Electronic TRAnsparent TRAcking system) helped 20,000 families and approximately 60,000 people in early 2023, ensuring that they received vital humanitarian aid. Jan P. Allebach, Purdue’s  Hewlett-Packard Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said: “Dr. Yih strives to make a difference in people’s lives, especially those who need humanitarian relief (e.g., food, water, medicine, hygiene, shelter) due to natural disasters (e.g. earthquakes, drought, flood, pandemics), conflicts (e.g. war, violence, crime), or low resources,” exemplifying her leadership in international development efforts and global engagement on behalf of Purdue.
Throughout his time at Purdue, Burniske has served as academic director for the four Mandela Washington Fellows Leadership Institutes and co-authored several NSF-funded projects, exemplifying his comprehensive leadership in globalization on Purdue’s campus. In support of Burniske’s nomination, Gerald Shively, associate dean and director of International Programs in Agriculture, said Burniske’s “impacts truly have been comprehensive and impactful in all three of Purdue’s land-grant mission areas. Gary’s enthusiasm for global programs is infectious, and his positive ‘can-do’ attitude is often the essential element in developing the teams necessary to successfully compete for external grants and contracts. Every day, Gary Burniske is working to help globalize learning, discovery and engagement on Purdue’s campus.”
In her letter of support, Rhonda Haan, executive assistant in the College of Agriculture, said Von Werder “has worked with hundreds of students and faculty to ensure the first steps in the introduction of Purdue University. Whether it is a high school student studying STEM-related courses or students traveling from abroad for the first time and learning how to do research, Rhonda has been there to help guide them along. She takes her role as PAGE and Global Fellows manager very seriously and goes above and beyond for her students. For many international visitors, this is a first look at Purdue and the United States. She helps take the fear and anxiety out of their experience and pours a lot of time, effort and heart into making these students feel cared for and catered to. They return to their own country having learned about engineering, but more importantly, how to live and navigate the world abroad.” Whether on campus or virtually, the numerous programs created and administered by Von Werder engage students from around the world.
The Outstanding Leadership in Globalization Awards are monetary awards open to all categories of full-time university faculty and staff members on the West Lafayette campus. Following the existing procedures for administering faculty and staff awards, each college or unit may submit up to three nominations for each award (i.e., three for faculty and three for staff) by March 4, 2024.
Nomination instructions are available online:

AI knows the score — and it could help instrumentalists make beautiful music,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University is putting artificial intelligence center stage with novel research examining the technology’s potential to improve musical performance, both on an individual and group level.
The multidisciplinary project takes the lead on innovating STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) and art through AI. The project is funded by a National Science Foundation grant.
Yeon-Ji “Kristen” Yun, a performing cellist and the project’s principal investigator, said music and AI already have been used together in areas like recording and composition.
“But it’s not been used much in music performance and education,” said Yun, a clinical associate professor of music at the Patti and Rusty Rueff School of Design, Art, and Performance in Purdue’s College of Liberal Arts. “So as a musician myself, I wondered if AI technology could actually provide a benefit to musicians and possible advantages to performance while keeping their creative ability.”
This project will develop and integrate techniques from computer vision, natural language processing and audio analysis to create two AI-enabled tools for string music performers. The first tool, the Evaluator, aims to improve individual practice and performance by analyzing audio and video of a musician, then comparing it to digitized music scores and a database of video performances. It will offer potential improvements by detecting deviations in the audio and posture adjustments in the video.
The second tool, the Companion, is intended to play the part of absent instruments in an ensemble by using audio analysis of performances to match tempo and style of the musicians.
The initial focus of the research is on stringed instrument performances, but the intent is for it to be used with any instrument.
“These tools can be for string players with any level,” Yun said. “They can be for professionals or for amateur musicians, young or old.”
Yun is joined in the research by Purdue co-principal investigators Yung-Hsiang Lu, professor of electrical and computer engineering; Yingjie “Victor” Chen, professor of computer graphics technology in Purdue Polytechnic Institute; Cheryl Zhenyu Qian, chair of art and design at the Rueff School; and Mohammad Rahman, the Daniels School Chair in Management at the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business.
Yun said the Companion tool is much more in-depth than simply reading the music and reproducing the song.
“Musicians have freedom to create their own interpretations,” she said. “If they place a note slightly longer or slightly slower, we need to separate the duration from frequency while still following the ensemble’s tempo.”
The team is looking at the research from the perspective of when AI technology can provide measurable benefits to musicians’ practice and performance as well as what factors affect future musicians’ acceptance of AI technology in their work.
Yun will collaborate on user studies for the project with Ka-Wai Yu, associate professor in music at Utah Tech University.

Purdue-led national summit issues call to action for resilient U.S. supply chains,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
More than 250 representatives from industry, government, academia and professional societies gathered in person and online Tuesday (Nov. 7) in Washington, D.C., for Purdue University’s inaugural national summit focusing on resilience through excellence in manufacturing and operations. Hosted by Purdue’s recently launched eXcellence in Manufacturing and Operations Purdue Engineering Initiative, or XMO PEI, the summit had the goal of gathering a dynamic coalition of partners to discuss building resilient U.S. infrastructure for and with digital, physical and sustainable manufacturing and operations.

“Reshoring, retooling and retraining for advanced manufacturing in the U.S. has become essential and urgent, and there’s no better place to accomplish the mission than the Midwest, especially here along the Hard-Tech Corridor,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “The XMO Summit brings expertise in the digital, physical and sustainable innovation of manufacturing across new materials, processes and applications. And it again demonstrates the national leadership of Boilermakers through Purdue@DC.”
The summit, which was held at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, focused on three key pillars of America’s resilience in advanced manufacturing: reshoring (also called onshoring), retooling, and retraining in manufacturing and operations, or M&O.
XMO PEI leaders said particular emphasis is needed to establish a resilient American supply chain for such critical industrial sectors as defense and space, agriculture and foods, transportation and logistics, semiconductor and microelectronics, and pharmaceuticals.
This initiative is aimed at overcoming the severe national challenges in the supply chain — for example, manufacturing for defense, semiconductor chips and microelectronics systems, food and agriculture, and more — that have been exposed in recent decades by events such as 9/11, COVID-19 and the Ukraine war, which shined a light on major gaps in manufacturing and operations in making the American supply chain resilient.
“Major supply chain gaps the nation experienced over and over, when coupled with manufacturing globalization, have jeopardized America’s ability to provide resilient commerce, defense and a high quality of life for all Americans,” said Ajay Malshe, the R. Eugene and Susie E. Goodson Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering and XMO co-chair. “Any supply chain is only as good as its weakest link. We need all physical, digital, sustainable M&O tools and a skilled workforce to make those links strong and tough to deliver supply chain resilience when the next national and global crises challenge us.”
Summit discussions included why U.S. companies are compelled to bring major elements of their manufacturing back to the U.S.; how new major investments in physical, digital and sustainable technologies and their rapid translations by engineering and business are necessary to build resiliency; and what role the educational spectrum will take to develop a diverse and integrative workforce in support of a second U.S. manufacturing and operations renaissance.
“The renaissance is critical for our ability to innovate and, hence, our prosperity,” said Stephan Biller, the Harold T. Amrine Distinguished Professor in the School of Industrial Engineering and Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, and XMO co-chair. “The U.S. is starting to make important moves toward building robust supply chains, but we need to be more focused on innovation and workforce development to achieve resiliency in manufacturing and operations that is digitally enabled and sustainable. This is particularly true for small and medium manufacturers that typically lack a manufacturing and operations innovation exosystem.”
The summit resulted in a seven-point call to action:
Form a national coalition at the intersection of M&O of industrial, government and academic organizations, along with professional societies.
Integrate M&O by funding sponsors in every aspect of research, development and implementation.
Enable large investments in physical, digital and sustainable M&O engineering for a resilient commerce and defense supply chain.
Build an innovation ecosystem for small- and medium-sized manufacturers to enable them to digitalize their physical M&O assets to participate in the ongoing artificial intelligence revolution.
Establish industrial policies and incentives for M&O to restore, retool and retrain, and grow and sustain the number of startups.
Invest in M&O’s physical, digital and sustainable infrastructure, similar (in scale) to the federal CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, for retooling rural and urban America for small-, mid- and large-size national enterprises and their ecosystem.
Infuse M&O educational content in every academic program to create and retain workforces for all enterprises.
More than 250 stakeholders attended the summit, either in person or virtually, representing 29 states. This is the second summit convened by Purdue in the nation’s capital this year, after April’s CHIPS for America: Execute for Success Summit in the Russell Senate Office Building.

Report ranks Purdue among top 10 universities for international student enrollment,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University is among the top 10 institutions in the U.S. for attracting international students, and climbed one position higher over last year, according to a new national ranking. The 2023 Open Doors Report, issued Tuesday (Nov. 14) by the Institute of International Education, shows Purdue is ranked No. 8 among 4,500-plus public and private universities in attracting international students and ranks No. 24 among all U.S. doctoral institutions in the number of study abroad students.
The report, which is based on fall semester enrollment and optional practical training data for the 2022-23 academic year, shows Purdue had a total of 11,872 students from abroad, representing around 130 countries.
Heidi Arola, assistant vice president for global partnerships and programs, said, “Purdue is an attractive choice for international students. They bring so much to our community, and their presence brings the world to Purdue, helping all our Boilermakers gain global competencies necessary to succeed in today’s workforce. At the same time, international students have a very positive impact on the economy of Indiana.”
The university’s international student enrollment rankings, based on the 2023 Open Doors Report, are:
No. 8 among 4,500-plus public and private institutions (up from No. 9 last year).
No. 3 among all U.S. public universities (up from No. 4 last year).
No. 2 in the Big Ten.
The international student body comprises 18.6% of the total number of enrolled students at Purdue. International students make up 11.2% of the total undergraduate body, while international students represent 42.9% of all graduate and professional students.
Notably, India surpassed China last year for the highest number of students at Purdue, with 2,698 and 2,359 students, respectively. That follows a trend seen at universities across the U.S.
South Korea (693) is third, Taiwan (423) is fourth, and Colombia (177) rounds out the top five.
At 41.5% of total international student enrollment, the College of Engineering has the highest percentage of students from abroad. The College of Science is second with 20.9%, followed by Purdue Polytechnic Institute with 10.2%. The Krannert School of Management (now the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business) attracted 9.8%, and the College of Agriculture represented 4.5% of Purdue’s international enrollment.
International students accounted for 6% of the total U.S. higher education population and contributed nearly $38 billion to the U.S. economy, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Purdue’s international students and their families also generate economic value for the state of Indiana and for Purdue. According to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, Purdue West Lafayette’s international students and their families brought an estimated $340 million to the U.S. economy, supporting 3,399 jobs. International students across Indiana account for $890.2 million and support 8,297 jobs.
Purdue also employs and hosts 1,244 international faculty, researchers and staff, representing 77 nations.
In addition, the university creates opportunities for Boilermakers to study abroad. The Open Doors report indicates Purdue ranks No. 24 among all U.S. doctoral institutions, with 1,351 U.S. students studying internationally for credit in 2021-22.
The 2023 Open Doors Report is released as part of the nationwide observance of International Education Week (November 13-17), a joint initiative established by the U.S. State Department and Department of Education.
Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Lee Satterfield said, “Students from around the world have chosen the United States as the top destination for international study. International education is a vehicle that promotes peace and cross-cultural connections and provides the tools necessary to address the shared challenges of our time. It continues to shape the leaders of the future, both here at home and abroad, and we look forward to doing even more to attract international students to the United States and serve as the global leader in international education.”
International Education Week is celebrated at Purdue through a variety of activities supported by offices and units campuswide, including Global Partnerships and Programs, which facilitates the university’s international efforts and initiatives and bolsters global opportunities for students, faculty and staff.
“The presence of international students on the West Lafayette campus positively impacts academic success for everyone,” said Chris Collins, director of International Student Services. “These students are among the best in their home countries, and we are fortunate to have them in our Boilermaker community.”

Purdue students win monetary prizes for innovative solutions to global problems during Moonshot Pitch Challenge,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
On Thursday (Nov. 9), teams of Purdue University students won cash prizes during the Moonshot Pitch Challenge, an ideation-focused judged event that featured two-minute pitches of solutions to address persistent problems.
Active Purdue undergraduate and graduate students across all colleges were eligible. Participants applied by submitting a video to explain the problem the team was addressing and propose its solution. Teams submitted their solutions in one of three categories:
Earth: Ideas primarily focused on addressing socioeconomic needs and challenges.
Orbit: Ideas primarily focused on launching a company.
Moonshot: Ideas primarily focused on solving a seemingly impossible problem.
Purdue Innovates Incubator organized the biannual event.
“The Moonshot Pitch Challenge is entirely about ideating bold, audacious solutions to address worldwide challenges,” said Justin Renfrow, Incubator director. “Purdue students are proving their ability to think critically about problems and then take the next giant leaps to solve them.”
First-place teams in each category received $1,500 apiece. Teams that won the Best Pitch and Crowd Favorite awards received $500 apiece. The winners were:
First place, Moonshot category and Best Pitch: Empyrean Energy, which harnesses space’s solar power for continuous, zero-emission energy on Earth, promising global access and environmental preservation.
Suryansh Panwar, an applied statistics student in the College of Science, said, “Giving the pitch in two minutes was difficult, but our focus was mainly on providing quality. I plan on going to the new-venture challenge next semester.”
First place, Earth category: BioVolt, which generates electricity using photosynthesis. Its biophotovoltaic panel erases carbon emissions while creating energy at the same time.
Ayush Karkare, a student in the First-Year Engineering program in the College of Engineering, said, “It took a lot of effort to present; I practiced for hours and hours. The product was the perfect culmination because we’ve been working on the same project for a long time, which made it easier to pitch.”
First place, Orbit category: Trackscout, which makes track and field recruitment easy. Athletes can assess their competitive status, access new recruit data and filter colleges by performance and academics.
Nathaniel Cherian, a computer science honors student in the College of Science, said Trackscout is planning to launch its product in a couple of weeks with a national release shortly after. “Our ultimate goal is to change the track and field recruiting industry, which we feel is badly managed and operated,” Cherian said. “The Moonshot Pitch Challenge money will be used for a good purpose when we start advertising to different schools.”
Crowd Favorite: OZO Diaper Pail, which creates a clean, odorless diaper storage experience by designing and prototyping a solution with an integrated ozone generator to reduce the smell and number of bags used.
Other finalist teams were Audio-Imagined, Autonomous Air Hockey Robot for Education, Battery++, Bulk Sauce, ChairCARE, EduChatify, Emboa, Garbage Gladiator, Maytik, Onboardr, Restaurant Link and Window Cleaning Drone.

Purdue Global law degree allows insurance executive to take next career steps,"summarize:Brennan Quintus didn’t need to go back to school. He was busy enjoying a successful career with the North Dakota Insurance Reserve Fund (NDIRF). However, a promotion to CEO within the company prompted Quintus to take that next step.
Law school was always in the back of his mind, as several friends and an uncle had become lawyers. In fact, Quintus explored going back to further his education at a brick-and-mortar law school.
“As I got further and further into the insurance industry, I realized there’s so many legal issues that come up,” he says. “You’re dealing with contracts and policy language and torts. I thought at some point that’d be really cool to get a law degree.”
However, as his family grew, Quintus knew a traditional brick-and-mortar law school was not an option.
Enter Purdue Global, Purdue’s online university for working adults.
Quintus began to search for a law school option that provided flexibility so he could still be the father and husband his family needed while also growing in the career that he loved. That’s when he discovered Purdue Global Law School, formerly Concord Law School.
“The Purdue Global option for an Executive Juris Doctor degree just kind of struck me, both from a cost-effective standpoint and also the history of the institution, having been the first to do the online law school. I went through the admissions process and felt pretty good about it.”
Quintus earned undergraduate and master’s degrees from the University of Mary in Bismarck, North Dakota, and worked with several insurance companies before landing at NDIRF in 2015. In 2018 he was appointed its CEO.
NDIRF is a nonprofit organization that operates as a governmental self-insurance pool and provides in-house claims, underwriting, loss control and administration services. It currently has 22 employees on staff and provides liability, automobile and equipment coverage to more than 90% of North Dakota local governments — including cities, counties, townships, school districts, park districts and other agencies. NDIRF also administers a property insurance program through a contract with the state of North Dakota.
Quintus’ predecessor had a law degree. While not a requirement, he had several conversations with NDIRF board members, and they were supportive of his decision to pursue a law degree from Purdue Global.
Purdue Global Law School offers an Executive Juris Doctor (EJD) degree, which according to Martin Pritikin, law school dean, is designed for students who want the advanced legal training that comes from attending a doctoral-level program at a law school but don’t want to become practicing attorneys.
“The EJD can be a great option for small-business owners who want to more effectively oversee and interact with counsel,” Pritikin says. “It is also ideal for business executives who want a leg up in their company or to become better at negotiating contracts, or those in HR who deal with legal issues every day, and those in highly regulated fields, like insurance and banking, who need to know how to navigate complex rules and ensure compliance.”
“I looked through a few different options,” Quintus says. “However, from its challenging curriculum to its incredibly distinguished and supportive faculty, Purdue Global Law School was clearly the best option for me. This allowed me to further my career without having to completely uproot my family.”
Quintus began courses online with Purdue Global in April 2019 with the goal of strengthening his legal knowledge of insurance.
He says that insurance policies are contracts, and having the legal knowledge to help draft such documents makes it beneficial for all parties.
A legal background also assists with looking at risks and exposure that municipalities face, especially with the various services they provide to residents, many of which are mandated by state laws.
Quintus explains that his law degree helps with the complex series of steps in reviewing a service’s risk, complex constitutional issues that can come into play and how those issues would intersect if a claim were filed against a local government.
“As I’m sitting there with a city’s legal counsel, I can speak the legal language completely. I understand what they’re talking about. They ask for our thoughts on their arguments and responses. We’re in the trenches with them,” Quintus says.
“This process works whether we are in the litigation, negotiation or mediation process. I can explain to them our strengths, weaknesses. The Purdue Global law degree helps me think critically about what the issues are and how we can position ourselves best to handle the claim for our members. There are all sorts of different angles within the insurance industry.”
Thanks to his coursework and commitment to excellent scholarship by law school faculty members, Quintus feels like an equal when working with other lawyers who graduated from brick-and-mortar institutions.
And while Quintus didn’t receive his law degree until August 2022, he experienced immediate benefits.
“After my first semester, I felt that a lot of this was clear and made sense. The skills I learned in law classes — torts, contract law, legal analysis and writing — I was able to put into practice right away at NDIRF. It really benefited me,” he says.
Quintus wanted to be the go-to person with his law degree. He had the insurance designations and education, but now combined with the legal education, he is able to be more productive to his colleagues and organization.
“I’m able to analyze the complex issues our members face. I’m able to communicate the legal analysis and conclusions and be at the same level as the attorneys that we work and deal with,” he says.
One memory that stands out to Quintus was meeting his favorite professor, Kelley Mauerman, who taught his Legal Analysis and Writing course, during the school’s 25th anniversary celebration in February.
“Some people think that it’s hard to have a connection with the professor like you would have in a traditional setting. Dr. Mauerman cared about our success and cared about our understanding of what’s being asked of you and provided help.”
Quintus had learned so much in his time with Purdue Global that he and his family now feel like they are lifelong members of the Purdue community. So much so, that the West Lafayette campus is sort of a destination preference for family vacations.
“We were leaving Mackey Arena after a men’s basketball game in January, and we’re walking back to the car, and the girls were already asking when we were coming back. So I jokingly said, ‘Would you rather go to Disney World or Purdue?’ Both of them immediately responded with Purdue.”
Between the courses, his experience on campus for commencement and the visits to sporting events, Quintus embraces and treasures everything Purdue Global has to offer.
“My whole experience has just far exceeded anything that I would have expected,” he says. “The classwork, the challenges, the skills and foundational legal concepts, meeting professors, and visiting Purdue’s main campus were important parts of my experience.”
Quintus could even see himself giving back to Purdue Global in the future as an adjunct faculty member.
“It’s a goal of mine to give back educationally to the insurance industry or teaching insurance classes for those just starting in the industry.”
That’s something that may not have even been possible if it weren’t for the online opportunities Purdue Global provides.
“What I was able to take away from that experience, I would put that up there with anybody. It far exceeded what my expectations were.”

Purdue pharmaceutical compound sounds the alarm on cancer cells and unleashes T cells,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Researchers in Purdue University’s College of Pharmacy are leveraging the dual roles played by an enzyme found in both cancer cells and T cells to create a novel cancer immunotherapy compound.
Zhong-Yin Zhang leads a team that has developed TP1L, a highly potent and selective small-molecule degrader. It targets the enzyme TC-PTP, or T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, in cells and deletes it.
He said recent studies have shown that deleting TC-PTP in certain tumor cells promotes antigen presentation, which alerts the immune system to the presence of tumor cells. Other studies have shown that the loss of the enzyme in T cells stimulates the activation and reproduction of T cells, which direct immune cells to fight and destroy tumor cells.
Zhang is head of the Borch Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Distinguished Professor of Medicinal Chemistry, the Robert C. and Charlotte P. Anderson Chair in Pharmacology, a member of Purdue Institute for Cancer Research, and director of the Purdue Institute for Drug Discovery. The research has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Chemical Science of the Royal Society of Chemistry.
Cancer immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the body’s immune system to find and destroy tumor cells rather than introducing pharmaceutical compounds that attack the tumor cells themselves.
Zhang said alternatives to current immunotherapy must be developed.
“Current immunotherapy approaches are effective only in 15% of the patient population,” he said. “The potency of current immunotherapy agents can be readily diminished as the cancer metastasizes and the genome alters. Also, current immunotherapy has been associated with substantial expenses and various toxicities, including neurological events.”
Zhang said TC-PTP’s dual roles make it an attractive target for developing novel cancer immunotherapy agents.
“Targeting TC-PTP with the small-molecule degraders represents an alternative approach to increase tumor antigen presentation and alleviate the inhibitory constraints on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment for improved immunotherapy,” he said.
Zhang and his team used rational design and systematic screening to discover TP1L, which he called “the first highly potent and selected TC-PTP degrader.”
“TP1L was developed by leveraging the cell’s ubiquitin-proteasome machinery to achieve selective degradation of TC-PTP,” Zhang said. “Through TC-PTP degradation and augmentation of TC-PTP substrate phosphorylation, TP1L can increase interferon signaling in tumor cells and intensify T-cell activation, therefore enhancing tumor-killing efficacy of T cells.”
After T cells kill the tumor cells, TP1L remains intact and can catalyze multiple additional rounds of TC-PTP degradation.
“We surmise that TP1L not only provides a unique opportunity for in-depth interrogation of TC-PTP biology but also serves as an excellent starting point for the development of novel immunotherapeutic agents targeting TC-PTP,” Zhang said.
Zhang and his team will continue to develop TP1L at Purdue.
“We will continue to improve the potency and drug properties of the TP1L and expand its utility of the degraders on different cancers,” Zhang said.
Zhang disclosed TP1L to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent to protect the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in developing the compound or commercializing it for the marketplace should contact Joe Kasper, assistant director of business development and licensing — life sciences, at jrkasper@prf.org, about track code 70394.

International Education Week to feature International Research Speakers Series,"summarize:International Education Week celebrates the benefits of international education and exchange worldwide. To mark the week (Nov. 13-17), the Office of Global Partnerships, together with the Purdue Policy Research Institute and the John Martinson Honors College, will hold the International Research Speakers Series featuring Purdue faculty, staff and scholars. Refreshments will be provided. Registration is requested at this link.
The speakers and topics scheduled for the week are:
“International Research Adventures,” featuring Michele Buzon, professor of anthropology, andBryan Pijanowski, professor forestry and natural resources.
Buzon will talk about her involvement in educational opportunities and exciting research around the world. Her training and work focus on archaeological excavation and analysis to reconstruct the lives of people who lived in the ancient Nile River Valley. She will discuss her recent research in Sudan and her collaborative efforts in building successful long-term projects. Site link: Tombos.org
Pijanowski’s professional goal is to record the Earth in order to discover how sound can help us better understand nature. Using advanced digital sound recording technologies, a backpack, two legs – along with trains, planes, jeeps, boats, horses, rickshaws, snowmobiles and other modes to navigate the globe – he has now collected 10 million recordings from some of the most exotic spaces of this marvelous planet. A short presentation of his research will be made using sound recordings that feature a 1,000-species dawn chorus in Borneo, the haunting sounds of melting glaciers in Patagonia, mysterious underwater neotropical pond sounds and the inspirational nature praise-giving songs of Mongolian herders.
“Opportunities at the Intersection of Research and Social Impact,” featuring Stacey Connaughton, professor of communication and director of the Purdue Policy Research Institute;
Pallavi Gupta, program director of LASER PULSE; and Yuehwern Yih, professor of industrial engineering and director of LASER PULSE.
The world we live in is burdened with many socioeconomic and environmental challenges. These are complex multidisciplinary issues that cannot be solved by the knowledge and resources of one group alone. Many of these issues require universities, government, and the social and private sectors to collaborate and share their unique strengths, knowledge and lived experiences. The elements of multidisciplinary research or best practices of collaboration building are not easily taught in the classroom; these are learned by working in a cross-cultural environment with multidisciplinary teams and practicing deep listening, empathy and mutual respect.
LASER PULSE, a $70 million USAID-funded program, has been conducting this work systematically for the past five years. The program has brought together 45-plus diverse cross-sector teams of researchers, students, policymakers, donors and private sectors in more than 21 countries and has helped them build strong collaborations to achieve a common goal of conducting rigorous research in international development. The issues that such cross-sector teams work on span challenges like agriculture and food security, democracy and human rights, economic growth, education, climate change, humanitarian assistance, water and sanitation, and conflict and violence prevention.
In this session, the panel will reflect on the program’s past five years in addition to their individual project experiences. Panelists will also discuss opportunities for student engagement, as well as the value proposition LASER PULSE, and programs like it, provide to student learning and student success.
“Exploring World Heritage Sites in Iran,” featuring Hossein Mousazadeh, postdoctoral researcher in the Community and Well-Being Learning Collaborative, John Martinson Honors College.
Mousazadeh will use an immersive display technology — the VisionPort — to take attendees on a journey to the hottest place on Earth: the Lut Desert. He’ll introduce a piece of centuries-old Iranian engineering — the Persian Qanat. These wonders of community engineering have been used to create irrigation channels over long distances and have been the basis of flourishing agricultural communities in the middle of an arid desert. Mousazadeh will speak about the sites and about working with local populations to develop tourism, community development and engagement in the area.
“Learning from Brazil’s Ethanol Framework,” featuring Danilo R.D. Aguiar, Fulbright Chair in Interdisciplinary Studies at Purdue and professor of economics at Federal University of São Carlos, Brazil; and Fabio H. Ribeiro, the William Nicholas and Elizabeth Holstein Delgass Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering at Purdue and director of the Center on the Innovative and Strategic Transformation of Alkane Resources.

Groundbreaking launches a giant leap in nursing and pharmacy education,"summarize:Purdue broke ground for the future Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building on Friday (Nov. 10). The facility will advance collaborative, innovative learning for health-care professionals while advancing Purdue’s land-grant mission.
Located at the corner of Mitch Daniels Boulevard and Russell Street, the building will house the School of Nursing, the Department of Pharmacy Practice and the College of Pharmacy’s administration.
“This cutting-edge facility will transform education at Indiana’s land-grant institution and address the state’s growing need for highly skilled nurses and pharmacists,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “We thank both the Indiana General Assembly and many donors for their support that enabled the most expensive building project at Purdue. The collaboration between pharmacy and nursing also demonstrated the promising direction for synergies in life and health science at our university.”
Purdue’s impact on the health of Indiana residents is especially great. Nearly two-thirds of the university’s nursing graduates work within the state while approximately two-thirds of all Indiana pharmacists are Purdue alumni.
“This collaborative effort between the colleges of Health and Human Sciences and Pharmacy will elevate our impact and opportunity,” said Aaron Bowman, interim dean of the College of Health and Human Sciences. “Working together, our students and faculty will make exciting discoveries through a focus on interprofessional learning and research.”
The innovative space will allow both academic programs to accommodate more students. The College of Pharmacy continues to graduate the largest class of pharmacists in the state, and the nursing program has more than doubled in size in recent years to help a shortage of nurses in Indiana and beyond.
“The Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building will help us prepare future nurses and pharmacists for long-term success in an ever-changing health-care system,” said Eric Barker, the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean of Pharmacy. “Here, we will equip our graduates with the essential skills and knowledge to deliver optimal patient care.”
The building will provide critical space for faculty and students to develop impactful strategies to address such critical issues as substance use, mental health, and health equity. Features will include clinical simulation labs, collaboration spaces, large active-learning classrooms and modern research facilities.","[{'summary_text': 'Located at the corner of mitch Daniels Boulevard and Russell Street, the building will house the School of Nursing, the Department of Pharmacy Practice and the College of Pharmacy’s administration . nearly two-thirds of the university’s nursing graduates work within the state .'}]"
Purdue helps put Indiana on the map in national security,"summarize:Indiana has emerged as a champion of national security, bolstering defense with research and development in the private sector, government and academia, and it could not be happening at a more critical time. That was the message of U.S. Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) and of officials of Purdue University and the Purdue Applied Research Institute (PARI) at an Indianapolis event on Oct. 30.
All parties highlighted collaborations that support this effort, making Indiana a leader in national security.
“This is the power of the heartland coming back,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang in introducing Young, the keynote speaker for the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition’s event, “America’s Role in the World: What’s It Worth to Indiana?,” at the Hyatt Regency Indianapolis.
Young is an advocate for the U.S. microelectronics industry, championing the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, and is credited for Indiana’s landing last month one of eight new regional semiconductor production hubs across the country.
With such steadfast support, Chiang said, institutions like Purdue have made great advancements and continue to grow in areas such as hypersonics, semiconductors, microelectronics, energetics and cybersecurity. “Purdue is also proud to be a leading university partner in our state’s competition for national hubs,” Chiang said. “Indeed, central to northwest Indiana is the only region of the country that won 3 out of 3 hubs: microelectronics commons hub, hydrogen hub and regional tech hub.”
Young, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, noted the current strife in Ukraine, the South China Sea and now Israel. “We scheduled this weeks ago,” he said of the USGLC event, “and I could not even imagine that this (subject) would be so timely.” He said it is important to continue supporting Ukraine and that “it’s essential we stand with Israel,” adding he has heard the Israel-Hamas war referred to as “their 9/11 on steroids.”
“There is a natural impulse to want to withdraw, to consolidate, to turn our attention inward,” Young said, “and that would be the most disadvantageous thing to us, to our way of life, to our future prosperity.”
During a separate discussion hosted by USGLC’s Veterans for Smart Power, officials from PARI and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, said it is the future that fuels support for collaborations like that of PARI and NSWC Crane. Both announced in September a partnership that will focus intently on microelectronics and hypersonics to start, then include more emerging technologies.
NSWC Crane is the leader in microelectronics and hypersonics, said PARI president and CEO Mark Lewis. “Microelectronics is a top priority because it’s the underpinning of almost everything we do,” he said. “Other than a hammer at Home Depot, just about everything has microelectronics. It is a critical system of every weapon. … That is why this partnership is so important.”
The partnership with Purdue could not have come at a better time, said Jenna Dix, director of engagement at NSWC Crane, noting the two entities have a long and storied tradition of collaboration.
“When you think of how we advance more quickly and overcome our adversaries’ advantage – we look externally as well as internally,” she said. “We have lots of smart people working for the Navy, but we know we cannot do it on our own and not on the timeframe needed. That is why our partnership with Purdue is beneficial for the nation.”
Dix emphasized that Indiana is a hub for defense.
“Your Hoosier neighbors are the national security experts that are growing technical leadership in our backyard,” said Dix. “Along with collaborations with universities and industry, NSWC Crane’s presence ensures Indiana is no flyover state when it comes to defense.”
Chiang told the audience that “as your land-grant institution,” Purdue will continue to serve Indiana and the nation by offering an affordable education that features the largest STEM enrollment among the top 50 U.S. universities.
PARI’s Lewis said: “We never want to be in a fair fight. We want such overwhelming capabilities that the fight doesn’t even happen, and that’s why we must stay ahead of our adversaries.”
Purdue University is a public research institution with excellence at scale. Ranked among top 10 public universities and with two colleges in the top 4 in the United States, Purdue discovers and disseminates knowledge with a quality and at a scale second to none. More than 105,000 students study at Purdue across modalities and locations, with 50,000 in person on the West Lafayette campus.

"Veterans Day: Purdue Global faculty, student reflect on their military service","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Tiffany Laitola, Richard Orona and Dusty Talton are all U.S. military veterans who use their military experiences to improve the lives of veterans, active-duty personnel and their families who are pursuing a Purdue Global education.
Laitola, Orona and Talton are all with Purdue Global, Purdue’s online university for working adults. Purdue Global has nearly 3,000 veterans enrolled as students and 133 veterans who are faculty or staff.
As the U.S. prepares to observe Veterans Day on Saturday (Nov. 11), the three shared their thoughts on their military service and journeys.
New Military Advisory Board to boost Purdue’s Online Learning 2.0 initiative
Purdue Global to offer new Military Physician Assistant Preparation concentration
Naval officer complements leadership skills with Purdue Global degree
Laitola of Massachusetts is an academic department chair in Purdue Global’s School of Business and Information Technology. She retired from the U.S. Navy on Sept. 1, 2023, after 30 years specializing in cybersecurity and cryptology.
This is her first Veterans Day as a veteran. Laitola said she has feelings of excitement and accomplishment about her time in the Navy. But now she is looking forward to serving other veterans and active-duty personnel who are enrolled at Purdue Global.
She was assigned at bases along the East Coast and in Germany; on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69); USS Barry (DDG 52), a guided-missile destroyer; and USS Wasp (LHD 1), an amphibious assault ship.
“My first duty station was on the Eisenhower in 1994, when women were assigned to combatant ships. That was interesting to be among the first group assigned,” Laitola said. “I really enjoyed the aspect of meeting new people from all over that had different interests and different backgrounds.”
She never expected to retire from the Navy, as there were different reasons for staying.
“My skills were great and marketable, but I needed a diploma to back it. I decided to go to school,” she said.
Laitola used tuition assistance to attend school in the late 1990s. She was determined to get a degree, overcoming challenges of working, raising twin boys and finding ways to pay her share of tuition.
It took her five years to earn her associate degree. “My core values kept on pushing me through,” she said. As time went on, she earned both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in the areas of information technology, cybersecurity and digital forensics.
Laitola discovered her gift for education, learning instruction and innovation, especially while working at the U.S. Navy Senior Enlisted Academy, and recently earned an education specialist degree. Now, being in education and keeping her ties to the cybersecurity/IT field is the best of both worlds for her.
“I work with the best people. It’s truly a blessing to go to work. I get excited when I see their faces,” Laitola said. “I’m constantly learning from them.”
Continuing her family’s military service to the country, as her father was in the Army, she now has one son in the Navy and another in the Army Reserves.
“I just found out that my son was taking classes from Purdue Global’s School of Business and Information Technology. He will be graduating in February 2024,” she said.
Orona of Texas is Purdue Global’s director of military health and nursing, a professor, and a consultant in the School of Health Sciences. He has been with Purdue Global since 2011, following his retirement from the U.S. Army.
A New Mexico native, Orona joined the Army one week after his high school graduation in 1981.
Starting as a dental specialist, Orona moved through the Army’s ranks to sergeant major and became the fourth dental command sergeant major. For his last assignment, he was the Army’s senior enlisted advisor overseeing building the world’s largest medical training campus, the Medical Education and Training Campus.
Orona utilized his education benefits and earned a master’s degree in organizational leadership from Thomas Edison State University and completed a doctorate in education from Northcentral University following retirement.
“It is truly an honor working for Purdue Global as a veteran. As a senior leader in the military, I was able to take care of service members with a focus on their overall well-being. As an employee of Purdue Global, I am able to continue serving our military and their families by providing education programs,” Orona said.
His dental and military background helps him and others in the School of Health Sciences build academic pathways for military personnel to earn credit for their training and education. Orona frequently talks with military personnel about their benefits, as well as ways to balance their work, family and education. He also can be found providing guidance and mentorship during courses.
One of his highlights each year is teaching the School of Health Sciences’ capstone program and celebrating alongside military students as they finish their program and earn their degree.
Orona’s thoughts on Veterans Day are filled with mixed emotions.
“I am proud to have worn the uniform for 30 years in serving my country with so many other veterans. However, I lost a son who was a staff sergeant in the Army to suicide, as he suffered from PTSD and depression after deployments,” Orona said. “It is easy to see how Veterans Day is a rough day for me as I am overcome with grief for losing a wonderful son.”
Talton was in the U.S. Army, leaving active duty in 1991 after Operation Desert Shield was activated.
Now Talton, who is enrolled in the School of Business and Information Technology, is working with her fellow veterans in a different way: She is president of the Purdue Global Student Military Association. She helps veterans navigate Purdue Global with student life resources.
The Purdue Global Student Military Association has helped make her experience at Purdue Global great, especially having the opportunity to connect with other veterans.
“Veterans Day for me is a day of reflection,” she said. “I utilize the day to check on other veterans and doing what I can to change the stigma of the 22 veterans a day who die by suicide. I am always available to anyone who needs help.”
One of her goals this year is establishing a Student Veterans of America (SVA) chapter at Purdue Global.
“The Purdue Global Student Military Association members are excited to bring all of the additional resources SVA has to our military family,” Talton says.
Talton recently attended the SVA Leadership Institute in Washington, D.C.
“It was an intense three-day event. They taught us how to utilize our strengths and knowledge to be top-notch leaders,” she says. “I can’t wait to share with the rest of the leadership team the tools I learned to help our team excel in our personal and professional lives.”

She’s on it: Josefine Eskildsen is rapidly rising up the racing ranks,"summarize:INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. —
Josefine Eskildsen’s racing career is accelerating as rapidly as the 350-horsepower touring cars she works on.
A whirlwind 2023 is wrapping up for the 22-year-old wunderkind, who just completed her second season with Bryan Herta Autosport. Already a full-time systems engineer for drivers Mark Wilkins and Mason Filippi, Eskildsen was a key member of a team that won a series-best three races this season in the International Motorsports Association’s (IMSA) Michelin Pilot Challenge.
Motorsports engineering program is fueling the industry’s future
Purdue University in Indianapolis: Launching Purdue’s first comprehensive urban campus and forming America’s Hard-Tech Corridor
Eyes on the checkered flag
Her fuel-strategy decision led to a trip to victory lane at Laguna Seca Raceway last May, and Eskildsen earned another prestigious honor that same weekend: her college degree. The latest success story from the motorsports engineering program in the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology in Indianapolis — part of the new Purdue University in Indianapolis — Eskildsen went from holding an IMSA trophy in California to being handed a diploma in Indianapolis in the span of 24 hours.
“That whole weekend was unreal,” Eskildsen remembers. “It was an all-green (flag) race, so we had to put it all together to win — get the fuel exactly right, get the tires done perfectly and have a flawless driver change.
“After celebrating with the team, I zoomed off to the airport, hopped on a plane to Indy and graduated the next morning.”
Contrary to many of her counterparts in the paddock, collecting trophies and standing atop podiums was not a childhood dream for Eskildsen. While she enjoyed working with her hands as a youngster, competed in robotics at Penn High School in Mishawaka and knew she wanted to pursue engineering in college, motorsports was not on her radar. That passion wasn’t ignited until later in life, the flames coming from an unlikely origin — her grandmother.
“My grandma has always been super into racing,” Eskildsen said. “But it wasn’t until we watched together when I was much older that I first noticed how cool it was.”
Initially, that interest didn’t extend beyond Grandma’s couch. Pursuing motorsports as a career didn’t become a consideration until one of her robotics teammates and classmates turned her on to the motorsports engineering program at IUPUI.
“I knew I wanted to do engineering,” Eskildsen said. “But once I discovered and learned more about the motorsports engineering program in Indianapolis, I said to myself, ‘Yeah, this is definitely what I want to go into.’”
When she arrived on campus, Eskildsen immediately slammed her foot on the pedal, joining the school’s motorsports club, where she later became president, and absorbing as much as possible from program director Chris Finch. Besides serving as the lead instructor in the program for Purdue University in Indianapolis, Finch also brings decades of racing experience as an engineer in both IMSA and the IndyCar Series to the table.
Eskildsen dove into Finch’s data courses, building a chassis loom — the essential part of a race car’s electrical system — as a class project, an assignment that allowed Eskildsen to gain essential wiring experience that she still utilizes today. In another course, she and her fellow motorsports engineering classmates were tasked with creating their own Excel fuel calculator, which helps determine on-track speed and pit stop strategy. Eskildsen’s familiarity and baseline skills in these disciplines, learned in the Purdue program, would quickly pay dividends early in her racing career.
At the end of the 2021 season and through a recommendation from Finch, Bryan Herta Autosport invited Eskildsen, a prospective intern, to Road Atlanta for the IMSA finale. Although she never completed a formal interview, the race in Georgia served as a successful trial run, and she’s been with the team ever since.
This season served as Eskildsen’s first as a full-time member, and there were several times that she and Finch, her mentor turned colleague, earned credit from their compatriots for race-winning fuel strategies. “It’s such a steep learning curve with a lot of stress and pressure because the fuel numbers from Josefine have to be right on the money,” said Wilkins, co-driver of the No. 98 Hyundai Elantra N TCR. “Her decisions were critical and put us in a position to win.”
Those real-time, in-race fuel calculations from Eskildsen are relayed to Wilkins and Filippi each lap. The drivers then know if they need to save fuel and how they can maximize their speed while limiting their stops, a delicate balance and critical key to success in all forms of motorsports. Thanks to those calls at Laguna, Wilkins and Filippi ultimately held off their Bryan Herta Autosport teammates, Robert Wickens and Harry Gottsacker, by just a few seconds in the two-hour race.
“My philosophy is you hire someone to do the job — not to constantly double-check their work,” Finch said. “It’s a matter of trust. I asked Josefine, ‘How much fuel do we need?’ and she told me 35 seconds, so we put in 35 seconds. The difference between us holding off our teammates to win the race was the difference of five seconds of fuel in pit lane.”
Capturing the checkered flag was extra special for team owner and president Bryan Herta, not only because it served as the team’s first of three victories in 2023, but because Laguna Seca is the site of his first IndyCar victory as a driver a quarter-century ago and the home track for Hyundai, the team’s engine manufacturing partner in IMSA.
Eskildsen and Finch aren’t the only Purdue products in the Bryan Herta Autosport garage. Fellow rising alumna Megan Ryder (BS, motorsports engineering, ’22) is the lead systems engineer on the Wickens/Gottsacker No. 33 entry that won the 2023 season championship. Reed England and Gretchen Waning are both interns and current students in the motorsports engineering program who are set to be part of the first Purdue University in Indianapolis graduating class in 2025. Many other Boilermakers have worked on the team in past seasons as well.
“Purdue students within our team have consistently shown they are prepared to tackle difficult real-world challenges and contribute to the on-track success of our program,” Herta said. “Josefine’s ability to ‘see the race’ and identify opportunities we can exploit to the team’s advantage has proven to be decisive on a number of occasions, which is why she has been entrusted with a great deal of responsibility.”
As a team, Bryan Herta Autosport just wrapped up its fifth consecutive IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge championship earlier this month. Wickens and Gottsacker were the drivers on that title-winning entry, but Wilkins and Filippi’s three individual race wins with Eskildsen were a season high and helped secure a runner-up finish in the points standings and a fourth consecutive manufacturer’s title for Hyundai.
The quest for championships puts Eskildsen in lockstep with her employer, and she continues to strive not only for success with Bryan Herta Autosport but continued breakthroughs for female motorsports leaders in what is still a male-dominated field.
“That aspect is always there in the back of my mind, as sometimes it feels like people are saying, ‘Hey, why is this girl in a fire suit?,’” Eskildsen says. “But I like to show everyone — not just other girls — that the opportunity is here and women can succeed in this space.
“I love to do things that others say I can’t do. Whenever people are standing in my way, I can’t wait to prove them wrong.”

Today’s feature focuses on Matthew Novack, assistant professor of mathematics, and his book, “Intermittent Convex Integration for the 3D Euler Equations.”
Intermittent Convex Integration for the 3D Euler Equations

Princeton University Press
July 11, 2023
To gain insight into the nature of turbulent fluids, mathematicians start from experimental facts, translate them into mathematical properties for solutions of the fundamental fluids partial differential equations, and construct solutions to these PDEs that exhibit turbulent properties. This book belongs to such a program, one that has brought convex integration techniques, inspired by John Nash’s pioneering work in geometry, into hydrodynamics. Convex integration techniques have been used to produce solutions with precise regularity, which are necessary for the resolution of the Onsager conjecture for the 3D Euler equations, or solutions with intermittency, which are necessary for the construction of dissipative weak solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations. The main technical contribution of this book is to develop convex integration techniques at the local rather than global level. This localization procedure functions as an ad hoc wavelet decomposition of the solution, carrying information about position, amplitude, and frequency in both Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates.
Matthew Novack is an assistant professor of mathematics at Purdue University. Previously, he was a postdoctoral fellow at New York University; Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, now known as SLMath; and the Institute for Advanced Study.
Novack’s research interests lie in partial differential equations, particularly those arising in fluid dynamics and related fields. His current research is partially funded by the National Science Foundation.","[{'summary_text': 'Matthew Novack is an assistant professor of mathematics at Purdue . his book, “Intermittent Convex Integration for the 3D Euler Equations,” is part of a program that has brought convex integration techniques into hydrodynamics .'}]"

Purdue sensors measure uric acid levels better than other noninvasive methods,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Researchers in Purdue University’s College of Engineering have invented and are developing noninvasive medical devices to make the monitoring and treatment of certain physiological and psychological conditions timelier and more precise.
Wenzhuo Wu, the Ravi and Eleanor Talwar Rising Star Associate Professor of Industrial Engineering, said noninvasive, repeated monitoring of uric acid (UA) levels in human sweat over long periods of time could enable the unprecedented diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of several conditions including anxiety and hypertension.
“My team and I have created new noninvasive, wearable sensors that monitor levels of uric acid in human sweat,” Wu said. “These patent-pending sensors, called EPICS, have higher sensitivity and better wearability and can be made from less expensive materials than traditional sensors that measure uric acid levels.”
A paper about the research has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Nano Energy.
Wu said UA is made in the human body as an end product of purine metabolism. It also acts as a kind of alarm that triggers inflammation as an immune response.
“Variation in UA concentration could indicate physiological diseases such as gout, hyperuricemia and hypertension, as well as psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression,” Wu said. “Recent studies report the physiological diseases associated with abnormal UA levels affect approximately 1%-4% of the world’s population and cost more than $20 billion in annual medical expenditures. The psychological conditions associated with abnormal UA levels impact 8.74% of the U.S. population and cost $33.7 billion in related medical expenses annually.”
Wu explained there are well-established clinical measures of UA levels in blood used for metabolism and nutrition control. He also said they have drawbacks.
“The intrusive nature of collecting blood and the delay between sample collection and analysis are major hindrances, especially to personalized remote treatments like flare-up prevention and just-in-time nutrition control,” Wu said. “Monitoring UA levels in sweat samples has the advantages of being noninvasive and offering real-time results.”
Wu said current wearable sensors to measure UA levels in sweat have several limitations, including complicated fabrication processes, sophisticated instruments, expensive raw materials and unsatisfactory performance.
“The UA levels in the sweat of a healthy human are significantly lower than the UA levels in blood. This means sensors must have superior limits of detection,” Wu said. “Additionally, continuous monitoring requires intimate contact between the UA sensor and human skin, which imposes further requirements for the wearability of the sensors.”
Wu and his team have developed EPICS, which are flexible and noninvasive sensors that monitor uric acid in human sweat. They created the sensors from zinc oxide, a nontoxic, biocompatible and electrochemically active material.
“Our design allows the possibility of noninvasive monitoring of UA with a boosted performance by otherwise wasted mechanical energy, such as that from the human body,” Wu said. “The fundamental piezo-electrocatalytic principles can also be extended to other piezoelectric materials with catalytic properties for high-performance sensing in the biomedical, pharmaceutical and agricultural areas.”
Wu and his team have tested EPICS at Purdue University’s Flex Lab since the summer of 2021. He said the results show EPICS outperformed traditional UA sensors in the tests.
“We demonstrated that the EPICS devices achieve a fourfold enhancement in the UA sensing performance with a small compressive strain boosted by piezo-electrocatalysis during the electrochemical oxidation of UA on the surfaces of mechanically deformed zinc oxide nanorods,” Wu said. “The EPICS devices exhibited a superior sensitivity and limit of detection outperforming all reported flexible electrochemical UA sensors.”
Wu and the research team will conduct additional testing to validate the on-body sensing of EPICS and to evaluate the sensor’s performance over time.
Wu disclosed the sensor innovation to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which applied for a patent to protect the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in developing and commercializing the innovation should contact Matt Halladay, business development manager II at the Office of Technology Commercialization, mrhalladay@prf.org, about track code 70183.

Former World Bank president to join Purdue University and its Daniels School of Business,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
David Malpass, former president of the World Bank and one of the world’s most experienced economic leaders, will join Purdue University starting Jan. 1, 2024.
Malpass will serve as the Distinguished Fellow of International Finance at the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business and as the Inaugural Fellow of Global Business and Infrastructure at Purdue@DC. He will split his Purdue engagements between Washington, D.C., and Purdue’s campuses in West Lafayette and Indianapolis.
Malpass is an esteemed international economist who most recently served as president of the World Bank Group from April 2019 to June 2023. Since 1984, his public service has ranged from deputy assistant secretary of the treasury and deputy assistant secretary of state to undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs. Malpass has also been a leading economist on Wall Street for many years. He served on corporate and nonprofit boards, including those for the Manhattan Institute, the Council of the Americas and the Economic Club of New York.“As president of the World Bank, David Malpass has been a truly impactful leader of international finance, infrastructure and business, especially his leadership during the major disruptions to the global economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine war, and the sharp increases in inflation and interest rates,” Purdue University President Mung Chiang said. “His joining the Daniels School of Business is another transformative growth of talent at Purdue University that will provide many exciting opportunities for many of our students and for Purdue@DC.”

While president of the World Bank Group, Malpass focused on helping countries improve their finances and economic policies to enable faster growth and job creation. He advocated increased transparency in global contracts, digitalization, currency reforms and active steps to build stronger markets and private sectors to improve living standards. During his tenure, the World Bank used strong growth in its funding and country engagement to commit over $450 billion in loans and grants, a 40% increase to meet multiple global crises. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Malpass was praised for supporting developing countries’ recovery efforts and leading global efforts to address severe setbacks in health, education, debt, electricity grids, climate costs, and the food and fertilizer supply chains.

“It’s outstanding for Purdue to hire this brilliant leader,” said Jim Bullard, the Dr. Samuel R. Allen Dean of the Daniels School since August 2023 and former president and chief operating officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “He is well respected in the business world and was a steadfast leader at the World Bank, creating solutions for some of the world’s most pressing issues. His insights and contributions will be relevant and timely to our faculty, staff, students and alumni, and his presence will only add to the momentum that the Daniels School is building.”
“I’m very pleased to be affiliated with Purdue University, its innovative leaders and the business school that builds on Mitch Daniels’ contributions to educational excellence,” Malpass said. “I look forward to sharing my public and private sector experiences to strengthen business leadership and am happy to become part of Purdue’s mission of being a leader in business education.”
Malpass hails from northern Michigan. He earned his undergraduate degree in physics from Colorado College and his MBA from the University of Denver as a Boettcher Foundation scholar. He was a CPA and studied international economics as a midcareer fellow at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service.

Ad Age’s Business of Brands brings together industry leaders to examine how the business of brands is changing and the role marketing plays in the evolution. Marketing leaders examine the catalysts, disruptions and innovations that are setting the stage for today’s brands.
“We have been on a remarkable journey over the past 18 months with Purdue Global,” said Kati Pratt, executive director of brand and marketing strategy. “Purdue Global is built for working adults. We see value in what they bring to the table and how they want to take the next step for themselves. Purdue Global is about providing real opportunity and opening doors for more students.”
Pratt and R. Ethan Braden, executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer for Purdue University and Purdue Global, will present “Reimagining Online Education” on Nov. 9. The talk will be moderated by John Dioso, Studio 30 editor for Ad Age.
Purdue Global’s own comeback started with conversations among Braden, Pratt and Purdue Global Chancellor Frank Dooley. Those conversations launched a collaborative effort with leadership, faculty and staff exploring what defines a Purdue Global education and experience in a crowded online market, tapping the more than 40 million Americans who have some college credit but no degree.
“This Is My Comeback” launched in April. Purdue Marketing and Communications engaged with longtime partners Ologie and BrandTrust, which also helped with Purdue University’s rebranding in 2020. A team conducted extensive research over a 12-month period with Purdue Global students, prospective students, student advisors, faculty, alumni and business partners. The current student snapshot at Purdue Global — which has more than 35,000 students enrolled and awards an estimated 11,000 degrees and certificates each year — includes these data points:
59% of students are 30 years of age or older.
40% of students are from underserved populations.
52% of students have a child or other dependents.
50% are first-generation college students.
Approximately 10,000 are military-affiliated students, a population that includes uniformed personnel, veterans and eligible dependents.
Purdue’s “What Can You Imagine at Purdue?” YouTube video — which has more than 29 million views since launching in November 2022 — was recently a winner for Best Motivational Video or Video Series in the 2023 Content Marketing Awards. The video follows a young girl as she imagines her educational journey — from completing high school at Purdue Polytechnic High Schools and then going on to Purdue’s flagship campus in West Lafayette, Indiana — as well as her father’s journey as he completes his degree with Purdue Global. The video concept was developed by Purdue marketing staff and produced by Toledo-based Madhouse.
In addition to winning Marketer of the Year and being named finalist for Project of the Year, Purdue was also a winner or finalist in seven other Content Marketing Institute award categories, which were announced earlier in the season:
Braden, B2C Content Marketer of the Year, Winner
“This Is Purdue” podcast — Best Podcast/Audio Series, Finalist

“What Can You Imagine at Purdue?” is also a finalist in Campaign US 2023 BIG Awards’ video category. Those awards will be announced Nov. 15 in New York City.
To some people, online education is characterized as something that can be done anywhere by anyone.
But at Purdue Global, it’s more than that. In many instances the person enrolled in online classes is balancing full-time work and caregiving responsibilities.
“Our team has been constructing this brand by building relationships with students and alumni,” Pratt said. “By being empathetic, passionate and personable and meeting them where they are, we’re able to gather authentic stories to share across our various platforms.”
During the past 10 months, team members have visited alumni and students in Chicago; Indianapolis; Fort Wayne; and Bloomington, Illinois, as well as at commencements in West Lafayette and Anaheim, California. Stories and videos are used across social media, media relations and more, including sporting events, as Purdue Global is in the second year of a multiyear sponsorship with Purdue Athletics.
“It’s a wonderful opportunity to share these comebacks,” Pratt said. “We look forward to sharing more comeback stories so others can be inspired to start or restart their journey.”","[{'summary_text': 'marketing leaders from the online school will share their experiences launching Purdue Global’s own comeback .

Purdue and leading companies chart a taxonomy of 6G technologies,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Today in Washington, D.C., 6G Global Roadmap: A Taxonomy is released to offer a taxonomy of technologies in the evolution from 5G — the fifth generation of cellular technology — to 6G. The document is the product of leading companies in the wireless industry, together with Purdue University, including:
Cisco Systems
Dell Technologies
Ericsson
Intel
Nokia
Qualcomm Technologies Inc.
“This technology report is meant to be a foundation of policies, not a policy itself. It is a taxonomy over the modularized layers and over time horizon this decade,” said Purdue University President Mung Chiang. “In the meantime, we strongly recommend the speeding up and scaling up of 5G deployments in the U.S. right now. More 5G infrastructure and resulting applications are essential to any road map to 6G.”
6G wireless networks promise not only faster speed, lower latency and better coverage, but also the connection of more devices than people and the offer of a foundational service to all sectors and across different types of networks and scenarios.
Purdue’s industry partners hold high opinions of what 6G can offer:
Michael Beesley, vice president and chief technology officer, Cisco Networking:
“Cisco has been honored to collaborate with Purdue University and our industry peers in putting together the 6G Roadmap taxonomy report. We feel that this report will serve as a powerful foundation for ongoing conversations around innovation, research, standards and use cases to ensure that the next generation of mobile technology helps to ensuring an inclusive future for all.”
Erik Ekudden, chief technology officer, Ericsson:
“5G is the innovation platform for consumer and business digitalization today. This report is an important step in forming the necessary partnerships that will be the foundation for the evolution of the mobile network toward 2030 with 5G Advanced and 6G.”
Nishant Batra, chief strategy and technology officer, Nokia:
“6G will expand and transform what a network can do, going beyond traditional performance metrics. Key dimensions, such as scalability, sustainability, trustworthiness and digital inclusion, will have significant impact on society in the coming 6G era. This detailed taxonomy report delves into the fundamental technical areas that will drive 6G development, which align with Nokia’s pioneering research on 6G over the last several years. In addition to promoting technical research and industry collaboration for the development of 6G, we must also address policy-related issues, such as the availability of new-spectrum, global standardization and an equitable, nondiscriminatory patent system.”
John Smee, senior vice president, engineering, Qualcomm Technologies Inc.:
“Robust connectivity is essential to many enterprises and consumers — that’s why it’s critical to continue scaling up 5G in the U.S. and globally and to research its next phase, 6G, which will take these technologies forward into the next decade, bringing benefits to industry and society when it launches.”
The report surveys the technical areas that are expected to drive 6G development and the important problems faced in these focus areas. These technical innovations describe a dozen enabling network architectures, protocols and tools in this decade’s evolution from 5G to 6G.
Enabling ultra-low-latency applications
Supporting intermittent connectivity
Creating wireless service platforms
Densifying cells
Scaling up edge/fog computing
Sharing spectrum
Using sub-THz spectrum bands
Sharing infrastructure
Using open interfaces
Utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning
Internetworking with Wi-Fi
Internetworking with satellite networks
The task force of industry and academia will continue to collaborate toward its next report, which will address further recommendations for the 6G evolution.

Experiment shows biological interactions of microplastics in watery environment,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Scientists have learned over the years that when aquatic organisms such as zooplankton become exposed to microplastics, they eat poorly. Research at Purdue University now shows that their plastic-induced eating difficulties also limit the ability of zooplankton to control algal proliferation.
“If the control of algae by zooplankton is confounded by the presence of microplastics, that could be a cause for concern,” said Tomas Höök, professor of forestry and natural resources at Purdue.
When algae bloom out of control, this presents a problem because some species produce toxins. Also, algal blooms can be associated with pea-soupy, unattractive bodies of water and contribute to hypoxia, a low-oxygen condition that may lead to fish kills.
Zooplankton are tiny creatures that live in watery environments and form the base of the food web in many aquatic environments. The organisms examined for the study were two common types of crustaceous zooplankton that differ in size and feeding behavior.
The study highlights how rife plastic has become in the environment. “There’s plastic dust in the air. We’re all potentially breathing plastic now,” said Höök, who also directs the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant College Program. Plastics are everywhere, he added, including in a lot of the food we eat.
Chris Malinowski, director of research and conservation at the Ocean First Institute, said, “The flow of plastics through the environment is reaching every part of the world.” Plastics are found atop snowcapped mountain peaks and on the ocean floor. The rivers in between serve as the vessels that help spread microplastics.
Höök, Malinowski and two co-authors presented their findings in the journal Science of the Total Environment. The study was among the first to examine the effects of microplastics in a simple food web design. This involved investigating impacts on how zooplankton feed on algae in the presence of different environmentally realistic microplastic concentrations and when faced with risk of predation from fish.
“Microplastics aren’t just having an effect on consumer organisms. They also have the potential to release algae from predatory control,” Höök said.
When the researchers noticed increased algal densities in their laboratory experiment after adding higher microplastic concentrations, they were uncertain about its cause. Either the microplastics were getting in the way of zooplankton and preventing normal consumption rates of algae, or they served as better surfaces for algal growth.
Follow-up tests showed that adding microplastics without the zooplankton failed to increase algae production. The microplastics were somehow affecting predation on algae. “That was somewhat surprising,” noted Malinowski, a former Purdue postdoctoral scholar.
Plastics can accumulate in biological tissue, similar to mercury and other heavy metals. But plastics also cause gut blockage and related effects that impact feeding, he said. And even though plastics break down in the environment into smaller and smaller fragments, which is not necessarily a good thing, the process plays out over many years.
“Different plastic products that we use every day, like cups, straws and bags, don’t truly go away,” Malinowski noted. Eventually, they degrade into microplastic particles, which by definition measure less than 5 millimeters, the approximate size of a pencil lead. Scientists find it difficult to sample particles of that size in the environment.
“In terms of the impact that microplastics have in the environment, there’s a level of uncertainty with these very small particles, in part simply because they are just very small, and also because they take on different shapes, sizes, configurations and surface properties,” Malinowski noted. “All of the research that has gone into this already and all that needs to be done is happening at too slow of a rate relative to the amount of plastic being produced, and this is alarming because we don’t truly understand all of the consequences.”
Co-authors of the paper include Catherine Searle, associate professor of biological sciences at Purdue, and James Schaber, formerly of Purdue’s Bindley Bioscience Center. The work was funded by Purdue University’s College of Agriculture and the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources and by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.","[{'summary_text': 'zooplankton eat poorly when exposed to microplastics, research shows . plastics can accumulate in biological tissue, but they also cause gut blockage .'}]"
Daylight saving time ends Sunday,"summarize:Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. Sunday (Nov. 5), meaning campus clocks will have to “fall back” this weekend.
Individual departments are reminded that they are responsible for changing clocks in their offices, research laboratories and departmental spaces. Buildings and Grounds staff will ensure that clocks in public areas and outdoors are changed.
In addition to changing clocks, the time change means that support and service hourly staff, police, and firefighters who work the third shift on this date will work one hour more than normally scheduled. For that shift only, employees typically working eight-hour shifts will work nine hours, and those who typically work 12-hour shifts will work 13 hours.
If an employee requests the option of flexing the schedule, it is permissible as long as it is done within the same workweek, it is at the employee’s request, and the supervisor approves the request. Employees on approved sick leave will be covered by the university’s sick leave policy. Supervisors and employees are encouraged to work together to meet both business and employee needs.

"PhD student focuses education research on misinformation, media literacy and AI, drawing from experiences as schoolteacher, journalist","summarize:Purdue doctoral student Benjamin Lathrop is helping frame the conversation surrounding disinformation and misinformation while publishing about teacher-focused research and tools on critical media literacy. He’s also examining another hot topic of the day: artificial intelligence and the ethical and practical questions surrounding generative AI technologies such as Open­AI’s ChatGPT.
While just in his third year as a Purdue doctoral student in the English Education program in Purdue’s Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Lathrop, a National Board Certified teacher, also draws on his years of experience as a high school teacher, journalist and parent.
“I suppose what I am focused on is ‘cutting edge’ in the sense that a lot of it is new and rapidly evolving because of changing technology, the explosion of social media and large language models such as AI,” says Lathrop, a Dean’s Doctoral Fellow in the College of Education.
“It’s going to be a huge issue — misinformation — with the political climate now. I don’t know if I could honestly say that I’ve stumbled upon something that no one else has thought of. But a lot of people are really interested in this topic now for the same reason as I am. And hopefully I’m doing something relevant that will be useful to teachers.”

Journal of Language & Literacy Education (JoLLE)
Lathrop recently co-wrote a piece about the tendency of ChatGPT to produce academic citations of fictitious studies with colleague and advisor Tara Star Johnson, an associate professor of English education and associate dean of learning in the College of Education. Titled “Researchers Beware: ChatGPT is a Bull****er,” the article was published in August 2023 by the peer-reviewed journal English Education.
Lathrop also recently co-authored “Honoring Rural Pasts, Presents and Futures,” an article accepted for publication in the blog “Writers Who Care.” Another English Education article, “Theory and Practice in Action as Teacher and Teacher Educator,” was published in 2022. His first academic publication, “From Engagement to Empathy: Performance in the ELA Classroom,” appeared in English Journal in January 2021.
Lathrop’s first publication of original empirical research, co-authored with Christy Wessel Powell, associate professor of language and literacy, was titled “We Shall Take Their Children Away and Rear Them to the Fatherland”: A Discourse Analysis of a ‘Parent Advocacy’ Group” and appeared in the Journal of Language and Literacy Education in 2022.
“It’s more typical for grad students to present at a couple of conferences per year and/or present as part of a faculty advisor’s or research team’s work,” Johnson says. “Almost all of Ben’s scholarship is solo-authored.”
While teaching in Minnesota, Lathrop successfully completed the lengthy National Board Certification process. He was then named a National Board Fellow and participated in a project in Virginia with four other fellows, including Juliana Urtubey of Las Vegas, who was named National Teacher of the Year in 2021 by the Council of Chief State School Officers.
“I was able to get to know her (Urtubey) before she was honored, so that was a great experience. That opportunity [to become a National Board certified teacher] also was a really transformative experience for me as a teacher. It revitalized my teaching and opened a number of doors for me,” he says.
Specifically, Lathrop says, he started working with other teachers — “as a teacher leader” — to advance his interest in mentoring younger teachers and conducting research directly applicable to those at the high school level. As he continues his PhD work, Lathrop supervises four to eight student-teachers each semester in the College of Education.
“The (National Board Certification process) got me interested in teaching from a different perspective and maybe thinking that I have something to give to the profession of high school teaching, which is what I really always envisioned myself doing,” he says.
In a roundabout way, that experience in interacting with classroom teachers and colleagues with National Board Certification process also got him thinking about a PhD pursuit through Purdue. As a high school teacher, he also was familiar with the Big Ten university from its popular Purdue Online Writing Laboratory, which offers global support through online reference materials and general writing advice.
As a life and career change appeared imminent, he connected with a cousin who was completing his undergraduate studies in engineering at Purdue and got a tour and firsthand testimonial about life as a Boilermaker.
So after 18 years of living and teaching English and journalism in Minneapolis-St. Paul, in 2021, he moved his family and three cats to Attica, Indiana, where they live in what he describes as a drafty three-story historic home built in 1889.
On a research topic that’s personal to Lathrop, he also presented in July 2022 at the English Language Arts Teacher Educators (ELATE) summer conference in Louisville. Titled “A Homeplace for Healing: Integrating Trauma-Informed Instruction into the Student Teaching Experience,” his presentation stemmed from a large, mixed-method study on trauma-informed instruction with student-teachers during his first year in the doctoral program. The report, which Purdue language and literacy assistant professor Ofelia Castro Schepers co-authored, is currently under review with the journal School Mental Health.
“There are teacher preparation programs (that include trauma-informed instruction), but they aren’t fully integrated like I think they should be,” Lathrop says. “I was working with some student-teachers, and I encouraged them to reflect on how they work and to come up with strategies for a workshop at beginning of the semester.
“I wanted to find out about what might work for training preservice teachers and trauma-informed instruction,” which, he says, focuses on helping teachers be more aware of trauma that students may have undergone. “It can change your approach to classroom management and instruction for all students.”
Lathrop has become a leader in helping Johnson manage the English Education undergraduate program, and has taught or co-taught five of the six English methods classes while assisting new instructors. Plus, he has served on committees for faculty searches. “He has been an invaluable part of our state and national accreditation processes,” Johnson says.
Publishing is in Lathrop’s DNA. Starting as a journalist in the newspaper business after graduating from Grove City College in 2000, he often saw his writing and reporting published daily and several times weekly. During his two years as a journalist, he published more than 100 articles.
To a PhD student and academic researcher, publication is far different than that for a daily journalist. But the experience has paved the way for where Lathrop is today — pursuing his doctorate and tackling tough research topics for education and educators. His years teaching in a high school classroom also have given him a unique perspective on helping teachers develop timely and impactful curricula for their students.
“I feel incredibly supported here, and I feel really lucky. It’s a  fantastic research assistantship that supports me in pursuing my research interests and working under my advisor’s supervision,” Lathrop says. “Professor Johnson has been very, very supportive of whatever I want to do.”","[{'summary_text': ""'researchers beware: ChatGPT is a bull****er,' says lathrop .

Purdue honors researchers with Seed for Success Acorn Awards,"summarize:Purdue on Wednesday (Nov. 1) honored more than 100 researchers with the university’s prestigious Seed for Success Acorn Awards.
The award recognizes Purdue principal investigators and co-investigators who obtain their first research grants with external funding of $1 million or more for a single proposal.
“Being awarded $1 million in research funding is a true milestone,” said Karen Plaut, executive vice president for research. “It is an important recognition of a researcher’s accomplishments and innovative ideas. It also recognizes not only what researchers accomplished today but also our hopes and aspirations for the future and the impact that they will have on the world.”
This year’s ceremony honored winners from the past three years, because award ceremonies were cancelled in 2020, 2021 and 2022 due to Covid-related restrictions.
“It’s wonderful to be back celebrating this community of scholars engaged in world-class research at Purdue,” President Mung Chiang said. “External funding of your work is an important reflection of your research excellence. We could not be prouder of your accomplishments.”
Last year, Purdue set a record in external research funding, reaching $613 million.
“Receiving the Seed for Success Acorn Award early in my collegiate career is very humbling,” said one winner, Kristen Seward from the College of Education. “I am honored to carry out gifted education research to change life trajectories of youth and value that Purdue recognizes the vital importance of this work.”

Purdue Global first-generation students create educational definitions dictionary to help navigate school,"summarize:Words like “accommodation,” “accredited,” “microcredentials” and “provost” can prove to be challenging terms for first-generation adult learners. On top of the many other hurdles students face, understanding the words and terms that professors use can be an adjustment.
That is why Maggie Morgan, academic department chair for Purdue Global’s Department of Human Services, led a group of first-generation students in the development of Speaking “University,” an online educational definitions dictionary, which helps students as they begin their educational journey or continue their comeback to finish their degree.

“My department has a greater number of students that have been traditionally underserved. One of the things in the research of first-generation students is often they’re the least likely to ask for help. They may feel intimidated or anxious, and they don’t know all of the language used,” Morgan said.
While the concept is not original to Purdue Global, Morgan says their dictionary version best fits the needs of all Purdue Global students.
“We have links so students can learn more about the term,” Morgan said. “We have it linked to the catalog, academic calendar and other places where they might want to find out more. It also teaches students to see the breadth and depth of things we have for them.”
Launched in June 2021, the dictionary currently features 111 words and has a link where students and staff can submit words to be added to the list. Faculty members have heard countless stories from students about how useful this tool has been. Students and instructors alike see the impact the tool is having.
“I try to connect the terms with the content of the seminar,” said Maria Brown, first-term instructor in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. “For example, we are studying the role of human services professionals in the public school setting, so we talk about examples of accommodations that we may advocate for students in K-12. I also share examples of accommodations that Purdue Global offers and encourage students to reach out if they want a referral. Earlier this year, one student said, ‘Wow! This university offers so much help!’ I often hear students say that they didn’t know that accommodations were available at the college level.”
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults, with more than 35,000 students enrolled and an estimated 11,000 degrees and certificates awarded each year. The current student snapshot at Purdue Global includes these data points:
59% of students are 30 years of age or older.
40% of students are from underserved populations.
52% of students have a child or other dependents.
50% are first-generation college students.
Approximately 10,000 are military-affiliated students, a population that includes uniformed personnel, veterans and eligible dependents.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey.

Life and Health Sciences Summit opens new opportunities for Purdue researchers,"summarize:Nearly 130 Purdue faculty, staff and university leaders met in a Life and Health Sciences Summit on Oct. 19 to explore and define opportunities to deepen Purdue’s leadership in these fields.
Ahead of the summit, faculty teams from seven colleges and 22 departments submitted 48 proposals for research topics where Purdue has unique, nationally leading strengths. Funding from a pool of up to $2 million was set aside to catalyze such faculty pursuits as part of a seed investment.
“At Purdue, we are fortunate to have such passionate faculty in the life and health sciences, and the number of strong submissions underscores this,” said Karen Plaut, executive vice president for research. “Of course, research excellence at scale means prioritizing; this summit enabled us to make investments in promising areas where Purdue has unique strengths and opportunities.”
In addition to the funded projects listed below, there were many exciting ideas proposed that will enable connections across research teams with complementary projects and the provision of services that continue to foster the success of many of the proposals.
Seed funding was awarded for the following projects:
Unlocking a Blueprint for Health: The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) as a Disease Safeguard. Team: Seema Mattoo, Vikki Weake, Bryon Drown, Fang Huang, Christina Ferriera, Jonathan Schlebach, Rams Subramanian, Eugenio Culurciello, Daniel Flaherty, Alex Chortos.

Science enabling heat and air conditioning for long-term space habitats is almost fully available,"summarize:Obtaining this scientific understanding would also help design technology needed for spacecraft to travel longer distances and refuel in orbit.
This research area has been named a priority for space exploration by the 2011 and 2023 National Academies decadal surveys.
The experiment is the second stage of a project that could “close the book on the whole science of flow and boiling in reduced gravity.”
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
To live on the moon or Mars, humans will need heat and air conditioning that can operate long term in reduced gravity and temperatures hundreds of degrees above or below what we experience on Earth.
Building these systems requires knowing how reduced gravity affects boiling and condensation, which all heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems use to operate in Earth’s gravity.
A Purdue University experiment that arrived Aug. 4 to the International Space Station aims to collect data scientists need to answer decades-old questions about how boiling and condensation work in reduced gravity.
Purdue professor Issam Mudawar started this project in response to a 2011 survey by the National Academies that guides NASA, the White House and Congress on areas of research to prioritize for funding. In the survey, which publishes every 10 years, numerous scientists recommended that a priority for space exploration should be studying the relationship between gravity and fluids.
The 2023 decadal survey also includes recommendations for future fluid physics research in space based on the progress of the experiments Mudawar has been conducting on the space station and the expertise he provided as a member of the survey’s panel on physical sciences.
“We have developed over a hundred years’ worth of understanding of how heat and cooling systems work in Earth’s gravity, but we haven’t known how they work in weightlessness,” said Mudawar, Purdue’s Betty Ruth and Milton B. Hollander Family Professor of Mechanical Engineering.
The experiment was transported via Northrop Grumman’s 19th commercial resupply services mission (NG-19) to the space station for NASA. The NG-19 spacecraft launched Aug. 1 from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA’s Wallops flight Facility in Virginia.
The mission carried a module for conducting the second experiment of a Purdue-designed facility called the Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE), which has been collecting data on the space station since August 2021.
Last July, Mudawar and his students finished their first experiment gathering data from a module of FBCE on the space station that measures the effects of reduced gravity on boiling. Using the facility’s additional components that arrived with the NG-19 spacecraft, the researchers will be able to conduct the second experiment, which will investigate how condensation works in a reduced-gravity environment.
Both experiments’ modules for FBCE will remain in orbit through 2025, allowing the fluid physics community at large to take advantage of this hardware.
“We are ready to literally close the book on the whole science of flow and boiling in reduced gravity,” Mudawar said.
To develop FBCE, Mudawar’s lab worked with NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, which engineered and built the flight hardware funded by the agency’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division at NASA Headquarters. The team spent 11 years developing FBCE hardware to fit into the Fluids Integrated Rack on the orbiting laboratory.
FBCE’s answers on boiling and condensation will not only support exploration on the moon or Mars but also help spacecraft to travel longer distances. The farther missions are from Earth, the more likely that the spacecraft for those missions will need innovative power and propulsion systems, such as ones that are nuclear thermal or electric. Compared to other types of processes that enable heating and cooling in space, boiling and condensation would be much more effective at transferring heat for spacecraft with these systems.
In addition, FBCE data could help enable spacecraft to refuel in orbit by providing scientific understanding of how reduced gravity affects the flow boiling behavior of the cryogenic liquids spacecraft use as propellant.
FBCE is among NASA’s largest and most complex experiments for fluid physics research. Mudawar’s team is preparing a series of research papers unpacking data the FBCE has collected on the space station, adding to more than 60 papers they have published on reduced gravity and fluid flow since the project’s inception.
“The papers we have published over the duration of this project are really almost like a textbook for how to use boiling and condensation in space,” Mudawar said.
With more than 30,000 citations, Mudawar is one of the most highly cited researchers in the field of heat transfer. Google Scholar ranks him No. 1 in flow boiling, spray cooling, microchannels, and microgravity boiling. He also is the most cited author in the International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer.
For more than a decade, Mudawar and his students have been developing three sets of predictive tools to be validated using FBCE data. One set of tools puts the data into the form of equations that engineers can use to design space systems. Another set identifies fundamental information about fluid physics from the data, and the third set is computational models of the fluid dynamics.
All together, these models would make it possible to predict which equipment designs could operate in lunar and Martian gravity.
“The amount of data coming out of the FBCE is just absolutely enormous, and that’s exactly what we want,” Mudawar said.

"Mental health, diabetes can impact each other; resources available to help","summarize:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that more than 37 million people in the United States are living with diabetes, of which Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases and Type 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 5% to 10%.
There are many complications of living with diabetes, which the CDC’s “A Snapshot: Diabetes In The United States” outlines. Key findings from the snapshot include:
$327 billion in total medical costs and lost work and wages for people with diagnosed diabetes.
Medical costs for people with diabetes are more than twice as high as for people without diabetes.
Risk of early death for adults with diabetes is 60% higher than for adults without diabetes.
People who have diabetes are at higher risk of serious health complications, including:
blindness
kidney failure
heart disease
stroke
loss of toes, feet or legs
While it’s relatively common knowledge that diabetes complications affect physical and financial wellness, the disease also impacts mental health. According to Mental Health America, people living with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for depression, anxiety and eating disorders, with the rates of depression across the lifespan being two times greater for those with diabetes than in the general population. Additionally, fluctuations in blood sugar can cause changes in mood such as fatigue, trouble thinking clearly and anxiety.
“Poor mental health can worsen diabetes, and diabetic problems can affect mental health,” says Lindsay Bloom, health coach at Purdue Fort Wayne. “But by improving either one, the other can improve as well. Depression is often caused by not being able to participate in activities you enjoy. As diabetes worsens, it can affect a person’s day-to-day activities and prevent them from doing everything they want to do. High levels of stress can cause blood glucose to rise, worsening diabetes. And the simple fact of managing diabetes can cause anxiety and depression.”
Resources are available year-round to help with both mental health concerns and diabetes management.
For instance, Bloom shared that “stress and anxiety can be lowered by being active, practicing relaxation exercises like meditation or yoga and finding time to do something that brings you joy — that fills your cup and allows you to recharge — can help.”
Additional resources follow.
Individuals who have Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes who want to better understand Type 2 diabetes and how it affects their body can participate in a free Healthy Boiler lifestyle program, which the Center for Healthy Living (CHL) offers each year. This 14-week program explains what Type 2 diabetes is and the role nutrition, exercise, sleep, medication and stress management can have on blood glucose levels.

That wasn’t ideal from a supply chain perspective, from a stability of goods perspective, from a storage perspective,” said Kurt Ristroph, assistant professor of agricultural and biological engineering at Purdue University.
Research team members Ristroph and Robert Prud’homme of Princeton University both have expertise in making lipid nanoparticles and processing them into shelf-stable formulations.
Prud’homme’s lab developed the mixing technology used to manufacture the lipid nanoparticles used in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine. Serán BioScience LLC, a contract manufacturing organization headquartered in Oregon, will provide process development and manufacturing support. The work is funded by a three-year, $2.7 million contract from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to Purdue, Princeton and Serán.
“We care about making a process that is large scale and operates continuously at large scale rather than being a batch-to-batch process,” Ristroph said.
The researchers are using the COVID vaccine as its model, but their methods should be applicable to mRNA lipid nanoparticles designed for other therapeutic uses. The Moderna and Pfizer COVID vaccines were the first to use lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA, but difficulties with storage and stability have slowed bringing new therapies based on the biotechnology to market.
More beneficial would be developing a liquid that could be stored at refrigerator temperatures of 4-6 degrees Celsius (about 39-43 degrees Fahrenheit).
“We’re concerned about the stability of the mRNA that’s inside frozen or liquid formulations,” Ristroph said. “mRNA is a very fragile molecule. It will tend to break down. You also want to make sure that your nanoparticles themselves stay stable. You need to be sure that what you’re putting into somebody’s arm is the same as what you manufactured in the first place.”
These stability considerations are key aspects of any formulation improvements and motivate pharmaceutical industry efforts to seek a method for drying nanoparticles into a powder that has longer-lasting stability than either frozen or liquid formulations.
“These nanoparticles are little balls of lipids. They’re colloids. They’re suspended in water, not dissolved,” Ristroph said. “If you can develop a good, scalable process to dry them out and still have nanoparticles when you add water back, we think that would help with overall product stability.
“A process to get to a dry powder that can be stored at room temperature would be terrific. But failing that, a dry powder that could be stored in the fridge or the freezer at less than minus 80 degrees Celsius would be better than the first generation of products.”",[{'summary_text': 'researchers are developing new formulations and manufacturing processes for the messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery systems used in some COVID vaccines . mRNA-based vaccines that came out during the pandemic required storage at subzero temperatures . more beneficial would be developing a liquid that could be stored at refrigerator temperatures of 4-6 degrees Celsius .'}]
CERIAS’ Shawn Huddy receives 2023 Community Spirit Award,"summarize:When Shawn Huddy moved from Virginia to West Lafayette four years ago, she wasted no time in developing relationships with local nonprofits and community leaders. It wasn’t just a key component of her job — it was something that came naturally to her.
Huddy began her career at Purdue in 2019 as a corporate support manager at WBAA radio, a role that allowed her to interact with volunteers and representatives from eight different Greater Lafayette organizations. Now the senior manager of strategic partnerships at the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS), she continues to make service a central part of her life.
“You go in with the goal of benefiting these organizations, but then you realize how they benefit you,” Huddy says. “When you work with others to put on an event and you pull it off, you have a sense of accomplishment. A sense of peace. A sense of community. You have a common goal, and you’re working toward the same thing. I think that happens in your professional life too, but it doesn’t touch the community in the same way.”
Huddy recently received the 2023 Community Spirit Award from the Management and Professional Staff Advisory Committee and the Campus Support Staff Advisory Committee. Established in 2011, the annual award honors a Purdue staff member who sets a high standard for service, encourages a sustained commitment to civic participation and inspires others to serve in their communities.
Amy Boyle, interim vice president for human resources, presented the award Oct. 10 during a joint meeting of the two committees. Huddy is the 12th Purdue employee to earn the award.
Huddy doesn’t hesitate to set aside time to support causes that have given her a sense of purpose in the community. During her lunch hour, she can be found in meetings for the Greater Lafayette Chapter of Indiana Black Expo (GLIBE), for which she serves as a board member. On the weekends, she’s making crafts, cooking or watching a movie with the child that she and her daughter, Bryleigh, mentor through Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Lafayette. Her morning and evening commutes to and from work sometimes include a trip to a local vet clinic, where she takes her foster cats and kittens from Loving Heart Animal Shelter to get spayed and neutered.
Even while she’s working, Huddy regularly assists organizations that complement the missions of CERIAS and Purdue. As a member of the Indiana Executive Council on Cybersecurity, she explores ways to motivate Indiana youth to unleash their passion for cybersecurity and encourage Hoosiers to pursue cybersecurity careers in their home state. She also serves on a steering committee for the University-Industry Demonstration Partnership, offering her expertise as the organization plans a 2024 inaugural conference for universities and industries in the Midwest.
“Shawn is an exceptional employee and dedicated to her work,” said Huddy’s nominator, Joel Rasmus, managing director of CERIAS. “I’m just amazed that she has dedicated so much of her personal time to community service.”
GLIBE was one of the first local organizations Huddy immersed herself in when she moved to West Lafayette. Now in her fourth year of volunteering for the local nonprofit, she finds pride in serving on several of its committees and taking part in events that benefit Greater Lafayette residents.
Whether it’s handing out anywhere from 300 to 350 bags of pens, pencils, composition books and other school supplies to local families during GLIBE’s annual backpack giveaway or organizing GLIBE’s upcoming “Living Our Best Lives” speaker series focusing on mental, emotional, physical and financial health, she is there and ready to work.
“I don’t know that I necessarily set out to leave my mark on the community, but at the end of the day, that’s what I want,” Huddy says. “I know we are having an impact, and that’s important to me even though it’s not why I started volunteering.”
Right alongside Huddy at most of her community pursuits is her daughter, whom Huddy introduced to volunteering at the age of 5. Whether Huddy’s impact is big or small, knowing that she’s raised her daughter to embrace and encourage acts of service is the biggest reward of all.
“I think it’s important for my daughter to understand the concept of giving — not just giving to charity, but giving of yourself,” Huddy says. “I want her to know that the world is so much bigger than our home, our town and her high school. There is a whole world of people who need a shoulder to lean on or a hand to hold, and I want her to embrace that.”","[{'summary_text': 'Shawn Huddy is senior manager of strategic partnerships at the center for education and research in information Assurance and security . she is the 12th Purdue employee to earn the 2023 community spirit award . on the weekends, she can be found in meetings for the Greater Lafayette chapter of Indiana Black Expo .'}]"

Purdue Global cuts ribbon on first military base extension,"summarize:VANDENBERG SPACE FORCE BASE, Calif. —
Leaders from Purdue University’s Office of Industry Partnerships, Purdue Global and Vandenberg Space Force Base gathered Wednesday, Oct. 4, for a ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the establishment of a Purdue Global education office within Vandenberg’s education center.
This represents the first time Purdue Global has opened an extension office on a military base, specifically designed to serve the educational needs of military-affiliated students and the surrounding base community.
“Purdue and Purdue Global have had a long history of supporting the military, including the Space Force. Purdue Global is excited to open this new office at Vandenberg,” said Frank Dooley, chancellor of Purdue Global. “We have been serving active-duty personnel, veterans and their families, helping many take the next steps toward a degree that can help them in their careers while in the military and beyond.”
Joining Purdue Global in this venture are the University of Maryland Global Campus, National University and Allan Hancock College. These institutions will join forces with base personnel to support service members, veterans and their family members in pursuit of higher education and professional development goals.
Kelli Diaz, chief of the 30th Force Support Squadron’s Force Development Flight at Vandenberg, expressed her enthusiasm, stating, “This is a landmark day for Vandenberg Space Force Base and the broader Vandenberg community. The presence of these highly respected educational institutions on our base is immensely exciting. Having them as close partners, collaborators and resources will substantially enhance our ability to provide educational support and offer improved opportunities for our uniformed personnel, veterans and their families.”
The establishment of this satellite office is the latest example of the work done at Purdue’s Office of Industry Partnerships, which connects businesses and other organizations with the university to create mutually beneficial partnerships that accelerate innovation and create lasting impact.
“We are committed to serving and answering the educational needs of service members, veterans and their families, ensuring that we can best meet their goals and introducing them to the full range of opportunities across Purdue University,” said Diana Hancock, associate vice president for educational partnerships at the Office of Industry Partnerships. “Once we are established at Vandenberg, our vision is to expand our reach to more military installations and serve more military-affiliated students through this on-base presence model.”
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults. Purdue Global serves approximately 10,000 military-affiliated students, a population that includes uniformed personnel, veterans and eligible dependents.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits.

‘Purdue Pursuits’: Becoming an A.H. Ismail Center member,"summarize:Charlie Catalano doesn’t back down from challenges; he runs toward them. It’s been a part of his lifestyle since 1998 — the year he completed his first marathon. Since then, he’s added 33 marathons, two duathlons, three full Ironman triathlons and 19 ultramarathons to his ever-growing running resume, including his most recent accolade, completing the Midwest Grand Slam of Ultrarunning.
Defined as footraces exceeding the 26.2-mile length of marathons, ultramarathons are epic endurance events designed to push runners to their limits — both physically and mentally. The Midwest Grand Slam of Ultrarunning is no exception. The event features five 100-mile races held in Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana that challenge participants to traverse 15,000-30,000 feet of elevation for hours on end in all types of weather conditions, all while battling their bodies’ demands for a change of clothes, a proper meal and some well-deserved rest.
After running, walking and shuffling a total of more than 147 hours and 1 million steps throughout the event, Catalano, an assistant professor of practice in the Brian Lamb School of Communication, was one of only three runners to complete all five races, earning him the title of “super slammer.”
“It’s punishing, but it comes with a lot of internal reward,” Catalano says. “If you have to choose between finishing the race or sleeping, assuming you can continue to function, you’re going to continue moving. It’s tough to be in that position because you’re battling your body and your mind while you’re still giving everything you have left in your reserves to just cross that finish line and collapse.”
Crossing through that final finish line is something Catalano had been working toward for over a year with the help and support of staff at Purdue’s A.H. Ismail Center for Preventative and Lifestyle Medicine. Located in Lyles-Porter Hall, the center provides state-of-the-art cardiovascular, resistance, balance and flexibility equipment — along with other amenities like fitness classes, personal training packages, and health and wellness clinics — to Purdue faculty and staff, graduate and professional students, and community members.
As a collaborative effort between the College of Health and Human Sciences’ departments of Health and Kinesiology and Nutrition, the center also serves as a centralized hub for multidisciplinary research — a place where faculty and students can tackle challenges related to health, exercise and nutrition. Students involved with the center also have the opportunity to refine their professional skills by supervising fitness assessments, training sessions and clinics.
The center isn’t only open to those with extreme fitness goals. Ismail Center director Jason Chrapek says individuals at all fitness levels are welcome to join the facility’s noncompetitive environment and exercise at their own pace.
“One of the most beautiful parts of the Ismail Center is that you will have members of the Purdue family from all walks of life and fitness levels working out with each other,” Chrapek says. “Charlie will be working hard in preparation for his tremendously grueling endurance events while a 76-year-old retiree is doing strength training in preparation for hip replacement surgery. The center provides the opportunity to take care of our own health so that we can best serve our families, our students, the university and the world around us.
Multiple times a week, Catalano can be found at the Ismail Center as he powers through cardiovascular workouts on the treadmill or elliptical, builds his muscular endurance with free and machine weights, and tracks his progress with a student trainer who’s helped him build and maintain a personalized fitness plan designed to prepare him for his ultramarathon pursuits.
It’s not just the staff who motivate Catalano to live a healthy lifestyle. The center’s family-friendly, relaxed atmosphere has made it easy for him to cultivate new relationships with other employees and community members who exercise there regularly.
“Prior to joining the Ismail Center, I didn’t focus on strength training or flexibility; I was largely one-dimensional,” Catalano says. “I consider the Ismail Center and the people who work and exercise there to be my accountability partners. They know what I’ve been aiming for, and they’ve helped motivate and inspire me along the way.”
Catalano’s fitness goals extend beyond participating in ultra-endurance sports. As a Type 1 diabetic, he strives to lead an active life that allows him to not only survive with the disease but also thrive with it. This, coupled with his rewarding yet bustling teaching schedule, continuously motivates him to maintain his commitment to living the most fulfilling life he possibly can.
“While I am a Type 1 diabetic, I do believe in ‘prepare and prevent’ versus ‘repair and repent’ when it comes to your health and wellness,” Catalano says. “Teaching and running are both ultra-endurance events. I want to perform my best both on the running course and in the classroom, and I think they go hand in hand. Each one helps me be a better and stronger version of myself.”
Though Catalano has had little time to fully comprehend the magnitude of his recent accomplishment, he’s already anticipating and preparing for additional ultramarathon races in 2024.
Next spring he’ll be celebrating his 53rd birthday in North Carolina, ready to tackle Badwater Cape Fear, a 51-mile-course known for its 39-mile stretch of sand. During the summer, he’s planning to traverse 206 miles with nearly 80,000 feet of elevation change in the Tahoe 200 Endurance Run, and later that fall, you can find him participating in Illinois’ Hennepin Hundred.
He may even apply for the Badwater 135, the crown jewel of ultramarathons that many ultra-endurance athletes are familiar with, but few get to experience. Crewed by a team of four people, runners trek from the lowest to highest points in the continental U.S. in conditions hot enough to fry an egg on pavement and melt the soles of tennis shoes.
“You finish by climbing three mountain ranges, so we’ll see,” Catalano says with a grin.
Ahead of each of these events, he’ll be training alongside Ismail Center staff, whom he says played a key role in his success in the Midwest Grand Slam of Ultrarunning.
“I don’t think I could have completed those first two trail races with only five days between them had I not been able to attend the center,” Catalano says. “It’s a very welcoming place, regardless of your age or fitness level. I genuinely believe everyone is welcome there and can find the help they need and something to do to become a better, healthier version of themselves.”
Annual and semester membership fees and personal training rates for Purdue faculty, staff, graduate and professional students, and community members can be found on the Ismail Center’s website.
Purdue faculty and staff can elect to become annual members of the Ismail Center through a payroll deduction option.
Individuals who have questions or would like to schedule a visit to the center should contact the director at jchrapek@purdue.edu.","[{'summary_text': ""charlie catalano has completed 33 marathons, two duathlons, three full Ironman triathlons and 19 ultramarathons . as a Type 1 diabetic, he strives to lead an active life that allows him to not only survive with the disease but thrive with it . he'll be competing in the badwater 135, a 51-mile course known for its 39-mile stretch of sand .""}]"

An astronaut and a communication advocate return to their alma mater as Presidential Ambassadors,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Andrew “Drew” Feustel launched himself from the Cradle of Astronauts directly into a life dedicated to the pursuit and promotion of science. His passion has led him from the bottom of the sea to the vastness of space.
Now Drew and his wife and partner, Indira, a speech-language pathologist, are helping others make those small steps to giant leaps as Purdue graduates and as thoughtful and strategic explorers into new frontiers.
Astronaut Feustel speaks live from International Space Station as he receives honorary doctorate from Purdue
2019 Astronaut Reunion
President Mung Chiang has named the Feustels Presidential Ambassadors of Purdue University, an appointment that became effective July 1. In this role, they will use their expertise, connections, passions and experiences to help further enrich the Purdue community by actively connecting with students, faculty, alumni and staff.
“Purdue University, the Cradle of Astronauts, has fostered generations of remarkable graduates,” Chiang said. “Wherever Boilermakers go, whatever projects they touch, they bring Purdue’s trademark attributes of creativity, perseverance, innovation and dedication. I am proud and pleased to welcome Drew and Indira Feustel onboard as Presidential Ambassadors.”
An astronaut, geophysicist and mechanic from Michigan, Drew flew to space three times, including the mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope and the final flight of space shuttle Endeavour. He also commanded the International Space Station for six and a half months in 2018 and has spent 226 days in space, including 61 hours spacewalking. He was acting chief astronaut at NASA prior to leaving the agency and has a lifelong passion for science, technology, working with his hands and training the next generation. He retired July 31 from NASA after a 23-year career.
“Purdue University has served as a cornerstone of inspiration for my entire life. One of my greatest role models was my great-uncle Robert Maximilian Feustel, civil engineer, Purdue 1909. After reading about his formidable life — strongly influenced by his time at Purdue — I realized that if I, too, wanted to be exceptional, then I, too, would need to develop my academic journey at Purdue. Following the footsteps of my father (mechanical engineering ’64) and uncle (mechanical engineering ’66 and ’67), and knowing Purdue as the Cradle of Astronauts, I focused to pursue my dreams. This university is where giant leaps were made in the past and where giant leaps will lead us to our future. Indira and I are honored for this prestigious appointment, and we look forward to inspiring many generations of Purdue University students to recognize that the sky is NOT the limit!”
He is the only Purdue astronaut to graduate from the College of Science rather than the College of Engineering. He studied in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, earning a bachelor’s degree in solid earth sciences and a master’s degree in geophysics. In 2018, while aboard the space station, Drew received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Purdue and delivered the spring commencement address.
While at Purdue, Drew met Indira, now his spouse. A medical speech-language pathologist and advocate, Indira is passionate about the importance of communication — even and especially in space environments. She has helped survivors of traumatic and acquired brain injuries and other neurological disorders regain the ability to communicate. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, to a Czech mother and East Indian father, Indira spent her childhood learning languages — four by the age of 4, according to her mother.
“The ability to communicate is very often taken for granted. I truly appreciate that by attending Purdue, I went to one of the top speech-language pathology programs in the country, which led to my rewarding career as a speech-language pathologist. My Purdue education helped me be the best I could be in delivering the care my patients and families needed and deserved during their recovery journey. My love of languages and unique experiences growing up in Ontario, Canada, as a first-generation daughter of parents who immigrated to Canada helped provide the empathy for others who struggle with communication and the passion to improve their skills. Communication is essential in all that we do in our daily lives, and it seems more crucial than ever. I look forward to my role as Presidential Ambassador — advocating for students and being a resource for them so they may enjoy the best experiences from their time at Purdue. The Purdue staff, faculty, alumni and general community are greatly inspiring, and I look forward to future events and collaborations together.”
As a team, the Feustels have worked to encourage students and people from a diverse array of backgrounds and countries. For example, Drew brought items to space including the plush Krtek toy, a favorite of Czech children of all ages; and a copy of “Moon Landscape,” a drawing by a Jewish child, Petr Ginz, from the ghetto and concentration camp in Terezin, near Prague, who perished at Auschwitz. Drew also took pictures of Earth from space, including Purdue University, and racetracks around the world. He uses these items and images to expose others to areas of science and research across technology and social boundaries. In 2019 Indira and Drew were awarded the Stars of Communication award from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association for their commitment to communication and science outreach to the public.
Inspiring and educating the next generation has always been as important to the Feustels as any advance in science or space, and they will continue to carry out that mission as Presidential Ambassadors. They will both participate in Purdue Space Day on Oct. 28; Purdue President’s Council activities in Naples, Florida, in February 2024; and Purdue alumni events in Houston, their hometown, as well as other engagements throughout the year.
Having soared through the vacuum of space and helped give speech to the voiceless, the Feustels are helping the next generation find their own way to the stars and beyond. You can follow their journey on social media at Andrew Feustel: @astro_feustel; www.andrewfeustel.com and Indira Feustel: @Indirafeustel.

Pioneering commercial astronaut and Purdue alumna Beth Moses to join President Chiang for Purdue Presidential Lecture Series,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Commercial space pioneer Beth Moses, who has successfully completed six spaceflights for Virgin Galactic and serves as its chief astronaut instructor, will join Purdue President Mung Chiang early next month for a conversation as part of the Presidential Lecture Series.
The public event, titled “From Purdue Alumna to Commercial Astronaut Pioneer,” is at 4 p.m. Monday, Nov. 6, in Stewart Center’s Fowler Hall. While the lecture series event is free, a general admission ticket is required.
“Purdue alumna Beth Moses is blazing her own trail as a space pioneer, becoming a professional astronaut who has been on six of Virgin Galactic’s nine total suborbital spaceflights since 2018,” Purdue President Chiang said. “Fortunately, this member of Purdue’s Cradle of Astronauts has time in her busy spaceflight schedule to be here on Earth for a return to campus as a guest in our Purdue Presidential Lecture Series.”
Moses joined Purdue’s Cradle of Astronauts when she made history Feb. 22, 2019, as the first female commercial astronaut to work in space as the sole mission specialist for Virgin Galactic’s test flight VF01. She conducted the first engineering evaluation of the passenger systems and cabin dynamics aboard SpaceShipTwo. During the flight, she also became the first human to unbuckle and float around during a suborbital spaceflight and the first test passenger to fly above Mach 3 in a commercial transport vehicle.
The Virgin Galactic flight climbed to a height of nearly 56 miles, qualifying Moses and the two pilots onboard for Commercial Space Astronaut Wings from the Federal Aviation Administration. The designation meant Moses became Purdue’s 25th astronaut, 16 of whom are graduates of Purdue’s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics. She also became the 571st human in space and the 63rd woman.

Moses wanted to make her inaugural Virgin Galactic spaceflight even more memorable by representing the university she credits with launching her aerospace career. She sent a rush request to Tom Shih, then head of Purdue’s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics. A staff member located a pair of Purdue pennants at University Bookstore and shipped them overnight. A gifted gold pennant is now displayed at Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering.
Moses made history again in July 2021, joining fellow Purdue alumna Sirisha Bandla on the first fully crewed commercial mission aboard Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity 22 flight, which reached 53.5 miles above Earth. So far this year, Moses has flown on Virgin Galactic’s test flight in May and aboard its commercial tourist flights in August, September and October.
As chief astronaut instructor for Virgin Galactic, Moses uses these spaceflight experiences to prepare other staff, tourists and researchers to fly in the cabin of SpaceShipTwo.
Virgin Galactic has been working for more than a decade to send paying passengers on short space hops, gaining the federal government’s approval in 2021. The company is aiming for 400 flights per year from its spaceport in southern New Mexico once it finishes building its next class of rocket-powered planes at a facility in neighboring Arizona. Company officials say an estimated 800 applicants are on the waiting list to fly aboard its spaceplane.
Before joining Virgin Galactic in 2013, Beth Moses spent 24 years with NASA, where she served as the extravehicular activity system manager for the International Space Station from design through on-orbit construction. She led the global program of human-in-the-loop testing, which designed, developed and verified the spacewalk mechanisms used to assemble and maintain the space station.
For her contributions alongside the global team, NASA and the space station received the Robert J. Collier Trophy honoring the “greatest achievement in aeronautics and astronautics in America” in 2009 for “successful design, development and assembly of the world’s largest spacecraft, an orbiting laboratory, promising new discoveries for mankind and setting new standards for international cooperation in space.”
Moses received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Purdue. As a student, she received the National Science Foundation’s Microgravity Research Award to conduct materials research in parabolic flight. She is the recipient of Chicago’s Adler Planetarium 2017 Women in Space Science Award and is a Google Science Fair judge. She was honored as an Outstanding Aerospace Engineer by Purdue’s College of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2018.
“My Purdue AAE education is arguably the most crucial tool in my professional toolbox — thank you, AAE, for your wise and enduring counsel,” Moses said. “You not only taught me the fundamentals of aerospace engineering but how to think independently, collaborate politely, be pragmatic and contribute to a better future for all. Not to mention how to survive all-nighters in the terminal room.”
Launched in 2014 by then-Purdue President Mitch Daniels and continued by President Mung Chiang, the Presidential Lecture Series exposes Purdue students and the broader community to inspiring ideas, courageous leadership and models of civic engagement and civil discourse. The Presidential Lecture Series has had over 40 guests of many viewpoints and perspectives and hosted some of the great intellectual, business and civic leaders of our time. As one of the world’s premier centers of scholarly leadership, Purdue is — appropriately and necessarily — a regular venue for great thinkers across a wide variety of disciplines.

Dry-surface foodborne pathogens under scrutiny at Purdue,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
During 2021 and 2022, national news reported on four infants being hospitalized and two dying after consuming infant formula tainted with Cronobacter sakazakii. The reports sparked the prolonged shutdown of a production plant that produced large quantities of the formula, leading to a monthslong nationwide shortage of infant formula.
The incident motivated Purdue University’s Haley Oliver to launch a project to improve the safety of low-moisture food-processing facilities. Oliver, a professor of food science, will collaborate with Old Dominion University’s Rishi Drolia on the project, which will target the C. sakazakii pathogen.
“It was a massive-scale food safety challenge that led to a food security challenge,” Oliver said.
Millions of infants were affected. Those in low-income households were hit especially hard. The incident magnified global food security issues that had already been aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. At issue are the foodborne pathogens that can form or become embedded under low-moisture conditions.
“We need to find practical solutions to controlling this organism in production environments that are challenging to clean and sanitize because these are dry products,” Oliver said. Adding water to a dry food-processing environment promotes bacterial growth, harmless and dangerous alike.
“Finding creative cleaning and sanitation solutions is key,” Oliver said. She and Drolia, who received his PhD in molecular and cellular biology at Purdue in 2018, will examine how cronobacter and associated organisms take up residence in a dry-surface biofilm environment. Their research is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
When the organisms attach to the surface in a dry environment, they can pull moisture from their surroundings. As they do so, they may remain in a living but dormant state that can give rise to sporadic contamination events.
“It’s not a predictable thing, but if pieces of biofilm break off into the environment, it can result in contamination events,” Oliver said. The pathogens can also be difficult to detect because they are not consistently growing in the production environment.
Oliver and Drolia will conduct their tests in a laboratory environment in consultation with industry stakeholders. “We are seeking industry guidance from the production side but also the sanitation-solutions side,” she said.
Drolia will handle the project’s microscopy imaging technology. Testing sanitizers or disinfectants typically require only one organism. Working with biofilm environments is different, however.
“We’re going to grow multiple organisms together. Rishi has an amazing microscopy skill set, so he can help us visualize how these organisms exist together in these lab-created biofilms,” Oliver said. “We know that some of the organisms survive better when pseudomonas is present.”
Pseudomonas, which can cause infections in humans, may help protect sakazakii pathogens. “We can find pseudomonas out in the wild. Are other organisms helping these pathogens set up residence or at least survive?” Oliver said.
The study also will include the listeria pathogen and salmonella.
“There’s a long list of food products that don’t support the growth of salmonella that can still be contaminated with it and subsequently cause disease,” Oliver said. “Even if it doesn’t have conditions to grow, it’s not dead. It’s like freezing food. It will stop the growth of organisms, but it doesn’t kill them.”
The researchers also will assess what genes C. sakazakii exploits to help it survive in dry food products and search for ways to inactivate or kill it.
“We’re bringing together multiple bacterial food safety challenges and our knowledge in sanitation and biofilms to work on a solution,” Oliver said.",[{'summary_text': 'four infants were hospitalized and two died after consuming formula tainted with cronobacter sakazakii . the outbreak magnified global food security issues that had already been aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic .'}]

By developing sorghum strains that withstand droughts and parasites, he has improved food security for millions. His advocacy for science, policy and institutions as key to economic development “has lifted the fortunes of farmers and strengthens the souls of nations.”
Ejeta has served at the highest advisory levels of science and national policy, including as special advisor to the administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, as science envoy of the U.S. State Department, and as a member of the National Academy of Sciences Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources. He also has been a member of the U.S. Board for International Food and Agricultural Development and the U.N. Secretary’s Scientific Advisory Board.
Ejeta is an advocate for purpose-driven research. His own work is focused on elucidating the genetic and physiological mechanisms of important sorghum traits. Grain sorghum is the world’s fifth-most important cereal crop. With its superior drought tolerance and broad adaptation, sorghum is grown worldwide, serving as a staff of life for over 500 million people in developing countries, and is the second-most important feed crop in the United States. Ejeta’s research addresses some of the most crucial traits of sorghum production and utilization, including nutritional quality; drought and cold tolerance; and resistance to pests, diseases and Striga. He also investigates concerns of global biodiversity, gene flow and the use of sorghum as a biofuel crop.
The goal of Ejeta’s sorghum research program is the development, release and deployment of improved sorghum cultivars for both food and feed use. His sorghum research is generally characterized by its sustained commitment to translational approaches that generates products and technologies from research findings to impact farm productivity and the eventual utilization and profitability of the crop postharvest. He utilizes a variety of research tools and works in interdisciplinary collaboration with a number of other scientists and programs. Ejeta has released many inbred lines and improved sorghum varieties and hybrids for use both in the United States and in Africa. His cultivars have been successfully deployed in several African countries.
Graduate education, mentoring of professionals and developing partnerships are integral components of his sorghum research program. Ejeta has trained and mentored a large cadre of domestic and international students and professionals at Purdue and in collaboration with other institutions. He has led many collaborative agricultural research and development projects, catalyzed the creation of public and private seed enterprises, and facilitated the formation of public-private partnerships in collaborating countries.
Ejeta was born and raised in a small rural community in west-central Ethiopia and was awarded the nation’s National Hero Award, Ethiopia’s highest honor, in 2009. He earned his master’s and PhD in plant breeding and genetics from Purdue, where he has been a College of Agriculture faculty member and researcher since 1984.

Purdue to offer vote-ready IDs for Mobile First students eligible to vote in general election this fall,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The PurdueVotes Coalition and Purdue University’s ID Card Operations/Support will assist Purdue students needing a vote-ready physical identification to participate in the municipal election in November and the primary and the general elections next year.
Purdue students registered to vote in Tippecanoe County will either need a hard-copy Purdue ID with a printed expiration date, or an Indiana driver’s license, a U.S. passport, a military ID or a free Indiana ID card from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Because of Indiana law, mobile IDs are not accepted as voting credentials at polling locations across the state.
Mobile First students who are eligible to vote in this year’s election can receive for free a vote-ready photo ID that meets state election requirements. Mobile First students will be directly notified by the university on the details for obtaining the vote-ready ID during a limited period ahead of the Nov. 7 election.
“The vote-ready physical ID is a viable option for incoming Purdue Mobile First students this fall who were issued mobile credentials as their primary university ID through the Mobile First effort within Purdue Mobile ID rollout,” said Tim Riley, university bursar and assistant controller for Purdue. “While Purdue’s new Mobile ID will not meet the state of Indiana’s identification requirements to vote in municipal elections this fall and the general elections in 2024, this partnership means Purdue Mobile First students can obtain a free vote-ready ID to exercise their right to vote.”
The vote-ready IDs, however, are not equipped with any technology and cannot be used by students in the place of their officially credentialed Purdue Mobile ID, according to Loribeth Hettinger, senior associate bursar of Purdue ID Card Operations/Support.
“We understand there is strong interest by the engaged Purdue students to participate in the democratic process by voting,” said Beth McCuskey, Purdue vice provost for student life. “We want to be helpful to the Purdue students in our community in every way we can. Enfranchising them to vote is another way we can do that.”

Students can register to vote in their home county and state, or they can register to vote in Tippecanoe County, but they can only register and vote in one place, according to Melissa Gruver, senior associate director for student leadership and civic engagement in the Roger C. Stewart Leadership & Professional Development Department who co-chairs the PurdueVotes Coalition.
To be eligible to vote, students must be a U.S. citizen and at least 18 years old on or before Election Day, which is Tuesday, Nov. 7. Key election dates this fall:
Oct. 10 — Deadline to register to vote in Indiana.
Oct. 24 — Early voting begins in Tippecanoe County.
Oct. 26 — Deadline to request an absentee ballot in Indiana.
Nov. 7 — Election Day voting at Margerum City Hall in West Lafayette.
The PurdueVotes Coalition, with support from the Office of the President and the Roger C. Stewart Leadership & Professional Development Department, is a campuswide committee that includes members from important stakeholder groups that work together to increase student voting rates and help students form the habits of active and engaged citizenship.

Purdue strengths in biotech manufacturing part of new federally designated Regional Technology and Innovation Hub won by the state of Indiana,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University is part of a consortium of Indiana stakeholders successful in securing a Regional Technology and Innovation Hub (Tech Hub) designation by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration, which recognizes regions poised to ensure the U.S. is globally competitive in areas that are key to national security.
Announced Monday by Applied Research Institute Inc. on behalf of the state, Heartland BioWorks brings together Indiana academic institutions, industry leaders, investors and nonprofit organizations to ensure that bioproducts invented in America are also produced domestically. BioWorks will develop new programs, infrastructure and networks to accelerate workforce development and help dismantle barriers to success for entrepreneurs and small-business owners with new biotech products.
This is the third successful federal hub designation for Purdue in the last month, including the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen, the Silicon Crossroads Microelectronics Commons and now Heartland BioWorks. The microelectronics commons hub is based on Purdue West Lafayette’s strength in semiconductors. The hydrogen hub has Purdue University Northwest as the only university from the state. The regional economic development hub is in the Indianapolis-Carmel metropolitan statistical area, where Purdue University in Indianapolis is opening in July. Purdue is the only higher ed institution in the country as a leading university in all three national hubs this year.
“Regional Tech Hubs from the U.S. Department of Commerce is a crucial competition for the tech-driven economy in our country, and a key element of the CHIPS and Science Act championed by Sen. Todd Young. This is a pivotal win for our state and our university,” Purdue University President Mung Chiang said. “Purdue is excited to work with ARI, and through Gov. Holcomb’s support, to win three out of three national competitions this season: in semiconductors from the Department of Defense, in hydrogen innovation from the Department of Energy, and now in biotech manufacturing from the Department of Commerce. Each is a 10% success rate opportunity, and hitting all three is yet another reflection of our excellence at scale.”
The Tech Hubs Program was enacted as part of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, with $10 billion authorized over five years and $500 million in FY23 appropriated to launch the program. There were 31 Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs, out of close to 200 applications across the country, designated by the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration. BioWorks will now compete against other designated hubs for implementation grants of up to $75 million each in year one of the program.
“Through BioWorks, we have assembled partners that bring together biotech and manufacturing research and resources that will ensure that Indiana continues to lead the nation in biomanufacturing,” said Karen Plaut, Purdue University executive vice president for research. “Purdue’s research mission supports national and economic security for all, and we’re eager to contribute our leading-edge R&D and training expertise in biotechnology and manufacturing for the health of people within our state and across our nation.”
Purdue has long been recognized for its interdisciplinary strengths in human, plant and animal health. Purdue has the No. 1-ranked agricultural and biological engineering undergraduate and graduate program in the nation and has been named a top 10 most innovative school in the U.S. for five years running, according to U.S. News & World Report. Purdue’s College of Agriculture, which has brought in more than $100 million in extramural funding in the last fiscal year, is ranked No. 3 in North America and No. 5 in the world in the 2023 QS World University Rankings. Purdue’s College of Engineering is ranked in the top four in the U.S. in U.S. News & World Report’s 2023 graduate ranking, and the university patent count is ranked in the top four in the country in 2023 by the National Academy of Inventors.
Indiana leads the nation in pharmaceutical exports and has the second highest concentration of life sciences jobs in the U.S. Purdue is a strong contributor to both the pharma R&D and workforce development pipelines, with nearly 100 drugs in the university’s pipeline and three Purdue faculty-discovered drugs having received FDA approval in the last two years.
Purdue also strengthened its commitment to pharmaceutical manufacturing last year with the launch of the William D. Young Institute for Advanced Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals, thanks to a generous donation from pharmaceutical and biotechnology pioneer and Boilermaker William D. Young. The Young Institute focuses on furthering pharmaceutical manufacturing to reduce costs and expand access to new drugs emerging from biotech research. It is one of seven interdisciplinary institutes related to health and biomedical sciences within the Institutes and Centers at Discovery Park District at Purdue, which are focused on advancing large-scale research in support of solving societal challenges.
The Young Institute also offers opportunities for workforce development, with the potential to train future Indiana workers in the basics of the pharmaceutical industry, and serves as a workforce training resource for Midwestern pharmaceutical companies. Purdue plans to bring pharma training through the institute to Indianapolis, including potentially through the university’s Indianapolis campus.
​​BioWorks will support the national need for domestic manufacturing operations for new (particularly small-batch) bioproducts and infrastructure dedicated to innovations in how those bioproducts are made, which will bring new bioproducts to market more quickly and encourage more businesses to start and grow in Indiana.

Keynote speaker to Purdue Global grads: Keep building your dreams,"summarize:Build the dream.
I believe in the power of building a dream and know firsthand that dreams come true every day. As I look at all of you, it is confirmation of believing in a purpose and building on your own dreams. Some of the key building blocks are leadership, vision, communication, accountability, consistency and, of course, execution. My journey getting my MBA at Purdue Global was firmly established with a dream!
Leadership comes with a price. You often make decisions that impact those closest to you. Many times you don’t get the opportunity to explain the decisions made, and often you’re misunderstood. Like many graduating today, I enrolled in 10 p.m. Eastern courses to make sure I could support the needs at home. I also would change my newborn while trying to stay engaged in the chat to gain credit for attendance.
The second building block to making your dreams a reality is communication. When I started my journey at Purdue Global, I told myself I’d take a few classes to see how it goes, and if it went well, I’d continue. My wife and family supported me and were overly encouraging. My wife told me to do whatever I needed to do and let her know what extra support that would be needed. The only challenge in my house was that our newborn son didn’t quite understand what supporting Dad meant. He thought coming into the office late at night wanting milk, changing a diaper, or to wave and talk at the instructors on Zoom was supporting the cause. As all great disciplinarians do with kids, I put a TV in the office with Disney Plus access. All great dreams are nurtured with communication. That helps with consistency and accountability.
My daughter helped me with the third building block — accountability. She told me that if I finished school, she would get her black belt in jujitsu. When I started school at Purdue Global, she was a yellow belt, basically starting the process. It took us four years, and we both quit three to four times, each, but always looked at each other as accountability partners. I often bribed her with fruit snacks and jumpy house outings. She would simply look at me and say, “Wait, are you a quitter, Dad?” And I’m proud to say that today, as I stand here speaking to you as a fellow Purdue Global alum, my daughter, Blake, has also qualified to test for her junior black belt. Although not always easy, it was accountability that helped us each reach these goals.
In addition to having a vision, communication and accountability, I’ve also learned that great dreams are built on consistency. I decided to write a children’s book. But I sat on that first book for over a year. Every time we had guests over, my wife would say, “You know Kahil wrote some children’s books.” I’d look surprised and say, no, I’m just playing around. Well, one day we had some friends over who are chefs. As we got talking, they mentioned they were in the process of writing a cookbook. I thought to myself, maybe I should really do this. After that conversation, my life changed. I completed and published that first book, and soon after, my book was ordered by schools, appeared in the local library, and I was even on a podcast. I thought to myself, how is this book getting to all these people? Insert my wife. Two books and 2,000 copies later, I finally started to embrace it — I was an author. It started as one, and before I knew it, I wrote five. I was overly excited about my work, and proof that consistency does pay off.  Funny story: While I was at an engagement, a few people were being introduced for community work. The emcee said “renowned author.” At that point I tuned out. A couple of people around me said, “Hey, they just introduced you.” My goodness, I couldn’t believe it; I didn’t think the lady was talking about me. As I learned, being consistent is key, and you also need to acknowledge and embrace the vision and dream. Needless to say, I’ve been supported throughout my journey as a dreamer from a strong family.
I first went to college in the early 2000s for my bachelor’s degree. I never thought 20 years later I would pursue my MBA. Over the last 20 years, I set a goal of impacting those who are less fortunate and building a career in sales and leadership development. I never lost sight of the need for further education, but I also got sidetracked. I would set reminders and put it on vision boards. While building a vision board with my daughter that included being a boss princess and a doctor, she asked me why I haven’t gone back to school since I always talked about it. I thought to myself, great question, Blake Cole! Blake went on to tell me that I needed to put the plan on paper and take it step by step and execute — little did she know that I was afraid, but our talk helped me gain confidence. I enrolled and started my journey and realized that dream was a reality. Execution only came after I had put all the building blocks in place and trusted the training. Purdue Global helped me and others sharpen our focus, identify what I do best — my calling — along with helping me understand when to raise my hand. I always felt execution was the finale. Truthfully, it’s the beginning of the next challenge and next phase. With execution comes pressure. Having pressure is a byproduct of your greatness.
Throughout my journey with Purdue Global, I’ve made amazing lifelong friendships. During my capstone class, one of my classmates took a bold business venture and attempted to buy a Chick-fil-A restaurant. I don’t know about you, but in our family, Chick-fil-A is a household name, so this business prospect I would definitely support. Unfortunately, the deal did not go through, so in solidarity with our classmate, four of us decided that the honorable thing to do was boycott Chick-fil–A. But I live in Georgia, with a Chick-fil-A on practically every corner. I was the first to cross the picket line. I have a 4-year-old and a 9-year-old. Chick-fil-A is a fabric of their lives! Joe, I’m sorry I could not boycott longer. But the beauty in not obtaining a restaurant at that time is that Joe was able to get a different high-level opportunity that would allow him to develop branding for multiple franchises. He has tons of insight on what business to move forward with when the time is right, and he has tons of flexibility to be a dad, which is his ultimate goal. I did have to take my kids to Disney to make up for the “boycott” — talk about a trade-off for loyalty, but to support new friends that are now more like family is priceless.
I want to share a quote that really resonates with me. It is from the novel by Juhea Kim titled “Beasts of a Little Land”:
“Everyone dreams, but only some people are dreamers. The non-dreamers, by far more numerous, are those who see the world as it is. Then there are the few dreamers, who see the world as they are. The moon, the river, the train station, the sound of rain, and even something as mundane as porridge become something else with many layers. The world feels like an oil painting rather than a photograph, and the dreamers are forever seeing hidden colors where others just see the top shade. The non-dreamers look through glasses, and the dreamers through a prism.”
Sometimes life has a way to bury our dreams — not you, not this group. At some point, instead of saying “I wish, I want, I think,” we said, “I am, I can and I will.”
Like many of you, my life has been built on the impossible. My parents and sister inspired me early on. My childhood friends gave me the belief that I could be great. My wife and kids let me know that nothing is impossible, on a daily basis. I’ve written books, invested in startups, mentored young people, executive-produced movies. My career is a dream come true! Saying that, completing my MBA and standing in front of you has been a top highlight for me. Seeing all of you other dream builders accomplish a goal is surreal.

Additional response on Oct. 20 to inquiries about some on-campus activities this week,"summarize:There are long-standing, content-neutral rules and regulations governing conduct and events on campus, considering factors such as: (a) compliance with law, (b) safety on campus, and (c) national security.
Furthermore, as both federal law and our own Commitment to Freedom of Expression recognize, there are exceptions to protected speech. Accordingly, true physical threats or incitement to violence or imminent lawless action, including but not limited to those made in the context of promoting antisemitism or terrorist activity, are not protected speech and will not be tolerated at Purdue.
Based on the assessment informed through the constant vigilance of local police and federal law enforcement agencies and with the advice of legal counsel, we are told that, at this time: (a) even speech of the most abhorrent kind expressed on Purdue’s campus in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel is nonetheless protected speech, (b) there is no police-validated threat to campus safety, and (c) there is no FBI-validated threat to U.S. national security from the current events on campus.
With an open campus environment and with the terrorist organization Hamas holding U.S. citizens hostage, these assessments by legal counsel and by law enforcement are updated continuously and could change any minute. Anyone with evidence of incitation of “imminent lawless action” or evidence of physical threat to either our campus or our country, please notify the Purdue University Police Department immediately. The university will take action the moment that any campus activity ceases to be protected speech.
In the meantime, since Oct. 10, when President Chiang visited Hillel, the university has been deploying resources to provide additional safety protections on campus, including to Hillel, as there will be zero tolerance for antisemitic violence, indeed any violence, at Purdue. Programming that celebrates Jewish culture is also being organized.
Based on the Chicago Principles and the Kalven Report, Purdue’s Commitment to Freedom of Expression states: “It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose.” We will ensure safe environment for such contesting.
Unlike some other universities, Purdue does not have the tradition of making institutional statements on important sociopolitical issues. For this university, this is not a newfound or selective habit, and it will continue in the future:
(a) we cannot compel good speech, even speech that condemns the most barbaric terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas, and
(b) we cannot censor legal speech, even speech that equivocates, justifies, incites or glorifies evil acts against humanity — speech that is clearly contradictory to the values of this university at this grave moment of barbarity vs. civilization.","[{'summary_text': 'purdue university has been deploying resources to provide additional safety protections on campus . there will be zero tolerance for antisemitic violence, indeed any violence, at the university .'}]"

Campus community encouraged to learn about earthquake preparedness today,"summarize:Purdue’s West Lafayette campus community is encouraged to review appropriate actions to take in case of an earthquake.
Today (Oct. 19) is the Great Central U.S. ShakeOut drill, an opportunity for people in schools, at work or with organizations to educate themselves and practice what to do during an earthquake.
“The campus community may not be aware that the Midwest has a number of active earthquake zones, and it’s important for members of the community to be aware of how they should respond if we experience an earthquake,” said Jefferson Howells, director of Purdue’s Emergency Preparedness and Planning.
Howells says procedures call for everyone to get on the ground, take cover under a table or desk, and stay put for at least one minute. Howells encourages faculty, staff and students to simulate a response and be aware of what could happen in their typical surroundings, including items that may fall, during an actual earthquake.

"Intentionality, strategy drive Purdue Global business dean for student growth","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Jeff Buck knows a thing or two about comebacks, strategies and logistics.
With his love for baseball and strategy, Buck — a former high school and collegiate pitcher known for his curveballs, knuckleballs and change-ups — compares life decisions to a pitcher’s choice on what to throw in a given situation, knowing that short-term decisions impact long-term results. And he encourages people — especially his business and IT faculty teammates — to think and behave with an intentional, forward-looking mindset.
Purdue Global’s organizational management program equips employees for new leadership, managerial roles
Purdue Global’s new aviation management degree program can take students to new heights
Securing career promotions after earning a Purdue Global MBA
Buck, who serves as the dean of Purdue Global’s School of Business and Information Technology, is an Indiana native who currently lives near Indianapolis.
In addition to being a baseball fanatic, Buck is a military veteran, having served in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps, where he specialized in logistics. During his military service, he developed a passionate interest in supply chain management and physical distribution.
When asked why he wanted to lead Purdue Global’s School of Business and Information Technology, his response was quick.
“My academic background has always focused on adult students and education and the online space. Purdue Global would have been the one institution to jump to. It was the brand and prestige of Purdue and the opportunity to serve an Indiana institution,” Buck says. “It was, for me, the opportunity of a lifetime.”
As dean of Purdue Global’s largest school, Buck and his leadership team are constantly looking for ways to reach more working adult learners and help them meet their career goals.
“I always felt the future included space for online education,” he says. “I feel the pandemic moved that forward by almost a decade faster than it would have been otherwise.”
Flexibility has been a hallmark at Purdue Global — especially for students. But it also applies to the classroom and course planning.
Buck says his school is looking at educational pathways in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with new courses coming soon. Following Purdue University’s leadership in the semiconductor realm, Purdue Global will be expanding degrees in advanced manufacturing and manufacturing management programs, providing additional educational opportunities to those who work in semiconductor plants being developed across Indiana and the U.S.
Another factor assisting in online education’s expansion is access to broadband. The convenience of taking classes at home and not having to commute to a campus will only climb, Buck says.
“The advances in technology and AI are going to drive us at a rapid pace into new directions. We don’t know what those directions are right now,” he says. “AI and other tools will have an impact on what we do with online education, especially as the platform evolves and expands.”
Purdue Global offers a Master of Business Administration and an ExcelTrack Master of Business Administration, which allows MBA students to move faster through the program.
“The MBA in general has value to those individuals who want to manage or lead any type of organization. The MBA is applicable to every industry and segment of workforce,” Buck says. “Purdue Global’s online MBA program design provides us the capacity to be flexible, relevant and deliver a practitioner focus.”
Another advantage of the Purdue Global MBA is the immediate impact of applying what one is learning to one’s workplace.
“The ability for students engaged in the workforce to take their education and apply it immediately in their career is a key differentiator of our program at Purdue Global,” he says.
The MBA, business and IT programs are built around skills needed for today’s and tomorrow’s workforce, with input from business partners and companies. The programs’ success is reflected in the outcome data.
Purdue Global’s National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) First Destination Data 2021 report shows there are several high-performing programs such as the Bachelor of Science in business administration, Bachelor of Science in cybersecurity, Master of Science in cybersecurity, and Master of Science in finance. The data shows higher knowledge, career outcomes and mean salary rates for Purdue Global than NACE’s rates for those degree programs at other schools. Purdue Global’s knowledge and career outcome rates for MBA graduates are also higher than NACE’s rates.
“Our business partners engage with faculty and share with us where their needs are and where their industries are moving,” Buck says. “We go through a very thorough process of looking at information on the labor market, trends and projections to update the curriculum. There is a lot of faculty awareness and insights into the trends in various fields.”
According to Buck, future initiatives include increasing education abroad opportunities and cultural awareness, service and experiential learning, and community engagement, and increasing the number of military-related students in the program.
Collaboration is a key ingredient in the School of Business and Information Technology’s success, as Buck highlights Purdue Global’s numerous cross-school and -department collaborations, including management programs in nursing and aviation.
“The programs and institutions that try to do it all by themselves with no collaborations will be the ones that struggle,” he says.
Buck grew up in a family with ties to General Motors’ factories in Anderson, Indiana, and he is a first-generation college graduate. Buck earned his bachelor’s degree and MBA at Ball State University, with a stint of active service in the U.S. Army sandwiched in the middle of those educational endeavors.
As Buck prepared for a career in higher education, he moved his family to Oxford, Mississippi, to attend graduate school at the University of Mississippi. He earned his doctorate in higher education leadership and business administration, focusing on organizational commitment, change leadership and market research.
He successfully served on the staff and as a faculty member at Ole Miss, but he was always looking for ways to be back home again in central Indiana.
In addition to working with first-generation students, many of the faculty at Purdue Global, like Buck, are first-generation students themselves. Currently 50% of Purdue Global’s students are first-generation students.
“Our faculty have a profile that mirrors the students they teach. They understand what it’s like to be a first-generation college student, balancing multiple responsibilities and obligations while going to school. The faculty also have a large amount of empathy,” he says.
In addition to having advanced degrees, many Purdue Global faculty members work in their respective fields and are able to share and demonstrate concepts and theories in real-world situations.
Following time in leadership and serving as the MBA director at Anderson University, Buck heard of an opening at Purdue Global, which he views to this day as “an opportunity of a lifetime.”
This opportunity has allowed him to witness and celebrate the lives being changed as students complete their degrees.
“Seeing the number of individuals with their personal comeback stories and how they have completed this part of their journey is very rewarding,” Buck says.","[{'summary_text': 'dean of Purdue Global\'s school of business and information technology says online education is ""the opportunity of a lifetime"" he says his school is looking at educational pathways in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with new courses coming soon .'}]"
"New institute accelerates future of microelectronic system integration, advanced packaging","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University is working toward the future in microelectronic product development with the creation of the Institute for Advanced System Integration and Packaging (ASIP) to enable faster designing and building of microelectronic systems.
The new institute, announced Wednesday (Oct. 18), highlights Purdue’s established research in system integration and puts new focus on advanced packaging at the university. Chip packaging ensures the functionality and reliability of a system, as multiple chips are connected electrically. Advanced packaging aims to revolutionize packaging by enabling complex functionality while reducing cost.

“Today, the U.S. only has 3% of the global packaging capability, but advanced packaging presents the U.S. with new opportunities. ASIP is the latest chapter of leadership for Purdue as the semiconductor industry seeks new ways to advance system performance and reshore packaging,” said Mark Lundstrom, Purdue’s chief semiconductor officer. “Purdue will lead the charge with a foundation of strong partners and a growing list of future collaborators.”
“ASIP will draw on the strengths of Purdue to accelerate microelectronic system integration and technology development while producing the high-tech workforce needed,” said Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb. “Strong partnerships with companies, research organizations and other universities will help establish Indiana as a major center of innovation in this critical technology. We look forward to working with ASIP to bring national and international microelectronics companies to Indiana.”
Purdue is working with Cadence Design Systems, one of its many U.S. and global semiconductor partners, to establish ASIP. Cadence is a leader in electronic systems design, with more than 30 years of computational software expertise to support and bolster the system design goals of ASIP.
“Purdue University is a nationally recognized leader in academic excellence and microelectronics workforce development,” said Tom Beckley, senior vice president and general manager in the Custom IC & PCB Group at Cadence. “We are excited to collaborate with Purdue to ensure that the next generation of advanced package engineers are equipped to design complex heterogeneous 3D-ICs while addressing multiphysics analysis challenges including power, thermal integrity, signal integrity, electromagnetics and mechanical stress. It is critical that graduating engineers are highly familiar with industry-leading commercial tools, thereby providing students, their future employers and the U.S. competitive advantage.”
Ganesh Subbarayan, ASIP director and Purdue’s James G. Dwyer Professor of Mechanical Engineering, said the institute’s creation will build a foundation for advanced packaging and system integration that has been neglected for too long. That makes ASIP a valuable contributor to the U.S. microelectronics industry moving forward.
“System integration and advanced packaging are huge opportunities for Purdue and a big priority for the nation right now,” Subbarayan said. “With ASIP, we envision designing a chip system from the beginning, envisioning a system to consist of multiple chips that are interconnected and with an advanced material that avoids having to put everything on a single chip.”
Subbarayan also is co-director of the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)-funded Center for Heterogenous Integration Research in Packaging (CHIRP). He said the university is one of a few with a strong focus on packaging, with four centers researching various aspects.
“Very few universities have established educational programs in packaging, which is an area of such critical need,” Subbarayan said. “We have developed a unique educational curriculum for semiconductors at Purdue, including packaging.”
SRC, a consortium of the top global semiconductor companies and the leading sponsor of microelectronics-related research in U.S. academia, will partner with Purdue in the ASIP institute along with imec, a premier research center for lab-to-fab semiconductor and advanced packaging research, and Osaka University, Japan’s premier research university for 3D integration and advanced packaging.
“SRC is a major sponsor of research and workforce development efforts at Purdue University through its funding of CHIRP as well as CBRIC, COCOSYS and NEW LIMITS centers,” said Todd Younkin, SRC president and CEO. “We look forward to partnering with the ASIP institute as we broaden and deepen our engagement with Purdue University.”
Dave Henshall, SRC vice president of business development, said, “The formation of ASIP is very timely. Purdue researchers have played a leadership role in developing the SRC MAPT road map for the nation, and we look forward to building upon that in ways that will energize advanced packaging design and manufacturing in the U.S.”
“We applaud the establishment of the Institute for Advanced System Integration and Packaging,” said Luc Van den hove, president and CEO of imec. “To cope with the increasing functionality of future systems, advanced packaging solutions such as 3D integration have become indispensable. To realize these complex systems, in-depth understanding and knowledge of advanced packaging is key, including access to modeling and simulation. With our long track record in advanced R&D on semiconductor and system integration and packaging and our mission to drive the semiconductor industry forward by collaborating with the entire value chain, we look forward to partnering with ASIP to build up the necessary knowledge. An initiative like ASIP is important to enabling the CHIPS Act and propelling the semiconductor industry forward.”
“Purdue and Osaka University are natural partners with their leading research roles in the area of advanced packaging,” said Katsuaki Suganuma, director of the Flexible 3D Integration Laboratory at Osaka University. “Our research strengths are complementary. We are actively engaged in creating collaborative opportunities between companies of our two countries to secure the global supply chain.”
ASIP tackles two aspects of chip production that have become integral parts of the industry.
System integration focuses on the design activity that precedes chip fabrication, looking at ways to avoid putting everything on a single chip by creating a system that interconnects multiple smaller chips, or chiplets. Future applications will require novel system integration solutions to achieve performance, power and cost trade-offs while ensuring efficiency.
Advanced packaging addresses the escalating cost of building chips by putting several chiplets as close together as possible to achieve the function of a single larger chip. This research includes looking at reducing heat production by design, heat removal strategies, ensuring fail-free functioning, and enabling sustainable manufacturing.
The need for chips in areas from computing, mobile communications and vehicles to defense and biological applications requires future advanced system integration and packaging like that represented by Purdue’s research.
Purdue is a national leader in microelectronics materials, devices, chip design, tool development, manufacturing, packaging and sustainability, spanning the semiconductor ecosystem in software and hardware with long-standing faculty excellence.
Strategic initiatives in semiconductors, such as the first comprehensive Semiconductor Degrees Program, which was announced before the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022, are intended to prepare a next-generation workforce for industry. Economic development and research collaboration followed as well, including from Skywater, MediaTek and Belgium-based imec.

"Songlin Fei: ‘A Digital Revolution in Forestry: AI and Lasers and Digital Twins, Oh My!’","summarize:Songlin Fei, professor and Dean’s Chair of Remote Sensing, Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, discussed “A Digital Revolution in Forestry: AI and Lasers and Digital Twins, Oh My!” at the Westwood Lecture Series on Oct. 18, 2023.
Abstract. Forests provide critical resources such as timber, fiber, and clean water and air, on which we are heavily dependent. Although digital technology continues to transform our daily lives, our forests are still managed using outdated technologies that are often imprecise and labor intensive. Here, I discuss how Purdue’s Institute for Digital Forestry is taking advantage of recent key developments in sensing technology and computational advancements to move this traditional field into the digital age. I highlight examples about how to merge cross-disciplinary knowledge to revolutionize the forestry sector, which has tremendous economic and ecological impacts. In particular, I showcase the use of different sensing technology from proximal, near-proximal, aerial and satellite-based sensing platforms and various AI models for automated measurement, monitoring and management of forest ecosystems.
Bio. Songlin Fei is a professor and the Dean’s Chair of Remote Sensing, and serves as the director of the Institute for Digital Forestry at Purdue University. Fei’s research includes forest ecology, invasion ecology and digital forestry. His research has significantly advanced the ecology and management of invasive species, the understanding of forest responses to climate change and the modernization of forestry into the digital age. His work has been published in over 140 peer-reviewed research articles, including those in Science, Science Advance, Nature Communications and PNAS.

New endowed scholarship to help international students facing substantial personal risks and educational barriers,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Thanks to the generosity of a Purdue University alumnus, some international students who have faced significant barriers to education in their home countries will be joining Purdue on full scholarship starting in the spring of 2024.
A significant multimillion-dollar endowed gift has led to the establishment of the Gilsdorf Women’s Engineering Scholarship. In the first semester of the scholarship rollout, two recipients from Afghanistan and Rwanda will be enrolled in spring 2024 in the College of Engineering and will participate in the Women in Engineering Program.
The recipients are the first cohort of Gilsdorf Scholars who will come from regions of the globe where girls and women face significant obstacles or outright bans in learning from the government, sometimes with fatal consequences.
“The well-deserving recipients have overcome great personal risk in pursuit of higher education,” said Norman Gilsdorf, who earned a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering from Purdue in 1977. “My wife and I believe that women are critical to solving the challenges we face in the world today, so to be able to collaborate with Purdue Engineering to support the education of these young women who can help shape our future is an honor.”
“Even this far into the 21st century, tragically, women are forbidden from studying under the rules of some regimes. That’s why Purdue University took the unusual step to match a philanthropic endowment, in this case from the generous and visionary gift by the Gilsdorfs, so as to provide a full-ride scholarship for each recipient,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “If a student has so much courage as to pursue studies despite grave dangers to her life, our university is excited to offer her free education through the Gilsdorf Scholarship in the land of ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and knowledge’.”
Gilsdorf Scholars will receive financial support to cover the full cost of attendance, including tuition, room and board, and program fees. Purdue will match the Gilsdorf gift with tuition assistance. Applicants must prove significant hardship, meet Purdue admissions requirements, pass the standard English language proficiency test, and take part in selection interviews.
“Engineers use their problem-solving skills to confront many of the world’s biggest concerns. The recipients of the Gilsdorf Scholarships will bring a unique, global perspective to Purdue to not only help solve challenges but enrich the profession,” said Beth Holloway, senior assistant dean for student access and success in Purdue’s College of Engineering, the Leah H. Jamieson director of the Women in Engineering Program, and professor of engineering practice in the School of Mechanical Engineering.
In 2010, Norman Gilsdorf received the Distinguished Engineering Alumnus Award from the College of Engineering. Gilsdorf has held numerous executive positions with Honeywell International Inc., and he was recently announced to serve as CEO of Plant.Digital, a startup joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Honeywell.

Purdue team examines bio-impact of toxic chemical cocktails in the environment,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University scientists are unraveling the complicated toxicity of a mixture of what are often called “forever chemicals” found in many consumer products.
In outdoor experiments under controlled conditions, the team found that tadpoles exposed to a common mixture of these compounds, called perfluoroalkyl and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), suffered reduced growth as they transformed into juvenile frogs. Size at this life stage is related to the survival and reproductive success of amphibians generally, said Purdue research faculty member Tyler Hoskins.
“There are over 5,000 of these chemicals out there that we know of, and that list continues to grow as our analytical capabilities grow,” Hoskins said. A common source of these chemicals is the fire-retardant aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF) that have been used for more than 50 years to douse fuel fires at airports and military sites. But PFAS are widespread environmental contaminants that are also found in fast-food packages, nonstick coatings on cookware, cosmetics, biosolid-derived fertilizers and a broad range of manufacturing processes.
“We were trying to mimic what aquatic organisms would experience if they were near a site where AFFF had been historically used. Water bodies at airports and defense sites are the areas where you would expect surface water to end up with AFFF,” he said.
Hoskins and nine co-authors published their results in a paper highlighted on the cover of the journal Environmental Science & Technology.
“PFAS are perhaps the most persistent class of chemicals we have created since we started producing chemicals,” said co-author Maria Sepúlveda, professor in the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources. “Studies that look at PFAS mixtures are very critical right now, and there aren’t very many because they are hard to do.”
Existing studies tend to examine PFAS at the cellular level in the laboratory rather than in whole animals. “There are very few because they’re hard to do,” said Sepúlveda, who is co-lead of the PFAS Strategic Research Team at Purdue’s Institute for a Sustainable Future.
A big challenge for scientists is how to sort the toxicity of various PFAS mixtures. In the field, Hoskins noted, animals become exposed to dozens of these chemicals at the same time. But when scientists run laboratory tests or outdoor studies under controlled conditions that simulate real-world environments, they often focus on exposures to three or fewer compounds.
“It’s rare to look at what’s actually in the environment,” Hoskins said. The team designed the study to examine the relative role of one PFAS in particular — perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) — as part of a mixture with four other PFAS.
The company that manufactured PFOS voluntarily phased it out in 2002. “But it’s still the most commonly detected PFAS in the environment and in animals. It’s a really important one to study,” Hoskins said.
PFOS accumulates in biological tissue more than most PFAS chemicals and also ranks among the most toxic. The researchers had hoped to resolve whether PFOS would stand out as the most toxic chemical of the mixture. Their results suggested, however, that PFOS was no more toxic than the other four PFAS in the mixture.
The U.S. banned another class of long-lasting toxic chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in 1979. There are close to 250 types of PCBs, compared to thousands for PFAS. Scientists discovered long ago that all PCBs act in the same way.
“With PFAS, that’s not the case,” Sepúlveda said. “There’s nothing unique that you can say, ‘Oh, that’s PFAS exposure.’ There are so many different mechanisms going on that it’s hard to study them because you don’t know how they act.”
In studies conducted over the last five years at the whole-animal level, Sepúlveda’s team has seen that each chemical in the tested mixtures usually has additive effects. The pervasive nature of PFAS complicates the studies.
“If I took a blood sample from you, you’re going to have a PFAS profile in your blood,” Sepúlveda said. “It’s composed of several chemicals, and not all of them have the same toxicity. You need to know how those might interact when they’re together to impact toxicity.”
The chemicals are commonly found in laboratory equipment, too. This includes glassware, plasticware and even the rabbit chow they feed the frogs.
“We found it in the tanks that leached. And worst of all, it’s in the rainwater,” Sepúlveda said. “How do you control for that? We can’t keep the tanks sealed. It’s a problem right now.”
The research team has follow-up studies in progress to further study mixture toxicity in insects and in aquatic community dynamics.
“Aquatic organisms exist in a community, and they interact with one another,” Hoskins said. “When one member of the community gets perturbed, that can have ripple effects for other members of the community. The community-level effects of PFAS have not received much research attention.”
The team chose amphibians for this study because they have an aquatic life stage and can breed near sites affected by AFFF.
“Just like every other animal, they serve important roles in the ecosystem,” Hoskins noted. They eat a lot of insects, including mosquitoes. And they serve as prey, in turn, for other animals such as herons, turtles and snakes.
“Chemicals serve a lot of important purposes for us. But if we’re going to put large amounts of chemicals into the environment, it’s our responsibility to understand what they’re doing to our health and wildlife health,” Hoskins said. “That’s what we’re trying to do here.”

‘Dreams really do come true. This was my chance to make it happen.’
How Purdue Global’s latest campaign empowers students to make a comeback (Adweek)
Through the effort, Purdue Global will collaborate closely with the Gardner Institute and 10 other institutions in the inaugural cohort over a five-year period to develop innovative strategies, enhance teaching and learning practices, and promote student success and retention. The Foundational Postsecondary Experience will help institutions move toward eliminating demographics, zip codes and other variables as the best predictors of who does or does not succeed.
“Purdue Global is proud to partner with the Gardner Institute on this initiative,” said Purdue Global Chancellor Frank Dooley. “There are over 40 million Americans who have some college credit, but no degree. As the only fully online program selected for the cohort, we have been assisting working adult learners, meeting them where they are at and helping them with their own personal comebacks. We look forward to sharing our strengths with our peers, as well as learning from them on how they help prepare students for success.”
“We are thrilled to welcome Purdue Global to the inaugural cohort of Transforming the Foundational Postsecondary Experience,” said Gardner Institute CEO Drew Koch. “The five-year commitment demonstrates the institution’s dedication to transforming the postsecondary experience for all their students.
“This is a bold action,” Koch added. “The university clearly recognizes that doing hard things requires long-term commitment, and improving student success in ways that maintain access, eliminate performance gaps and uphold quality is very hard. But Purdue Global is committed to doing this hard work. That is why it was selected to take part.”
The 11 participating institutions in the inaugural cohort enroll nearly 115,000 undergraduate students. Over two-fifths (43%) of those students receive a Pell Grant; over two-fifths (41%) identify as African American, Hispanic, Indigenous or two or more races. The participating institutions include:

"Strength of Purdue’s pharmacy graduate program felt in improved lives, purposed service, rewarding careers in health care","summarize:About This Series: This story is part of an ongoing Purdue Today series highlighting programs ranked in the Top 10 or Top 10th percentile among our peers nationally, demonstrating the university’s persistent pursuit of excellence, innovation and transformative learning.
As the link between patients and medicine, pharmacists today must be experts on prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications, understanding use, side effects and mixtures of medicine. If not at that patient connection point, they are in the research laboratories, assisting in the development of next-generation medication in preventing illnesses or treating cancer and chronic diseases such as diabetes and arthritis.
Few university programs across the nation better equip the next generation of pharmacists, pharmaceutical researchers and groundbreaking drug discovery and development leaders than Purdue University’s College of Pharmacy. The Purdue graduate program is ranked No. 7 in the most recent U.S. News & World Report list, which was compiled in 2020 and included 134 schools and programs offering Doctor of Pharmacy degrees accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education.
“Purdue’s passionate commitment to world-changing research and transformative education is well reflected in its wide variety of pharmacy programs,” says Eric Barker, the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean of Pharmacy. “Add up all the ingredients to the Purdue difference — top-notch teachers, cutting-edge research facilities, and a broad variety of pharmacy programs with up-to-the-minute curricula flexible enough to prepare students for almost any career path in the field of pharmacy — and you’ll see that Purdue offers students unparalleled opportunities in pharmacy education.”

New building to elevate transformative education for Purdue nursing and pharmacy programs
History of the 130-year-old Purdue College of Pharmacy
Supported by a distinguished faculty, state-of-art facility and productive collaborations within the pharmaceutical industry, Purdue’s pharmacy program nurtures its students’ academic ambitions with many initiatives. Those include an innovative professional curriculum and strategic alliances at the local, regional and international levels.
Purdue offers a four-year Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program, designed to prepare students to excel in the field of pharmacy. The program is based on an integrated approach with the right emphasis on classroom, lab and experiential learning, ensuring students not only have a strong foundation but also gain valuable hands-on experience.
Purdue’s PharmD program has over 85 faculty. The school is especially renowned for its research in pharmaceutical development, and the PharmD has a significant laboratory component.
Working as a research scientist at Chicago-based biopharmaceutical firm AbbVie Inc., Alex Deac enjoyed the fast-paced environment where he formulated products for clinical trials and developed life-cycle improvements for Duopa, a prescription medication used for treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. Although he loved the work, in his five years at the bench he noticed scientific gaps related to poorly soluble drugs.
Now a graduate research assistant at Purdue, Deac works with Lynne Taylor, the Retter Distinguished Professor of Pharmacy and a world-renowned expert in enhancing the delivery, efficacy and safety of drugs. The Taylor Lab, part of the newly renamed Department of Industrial and Molecular Pharmaceutics, explores the fundamental science underlying the preformulation, formulation and manufacturing of drugs.
“Industry really focuses on the development of pharmaceuticals,” says Deac, a 2023 PharmD graduate.
“While they do research, they’re more focused on bringing APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) to market. The fundamental science behind the properties of a formulation is more the realm of academia. That’s why I wanted to pursue a PhD at Purdue — to gain more fundamental knowledge behind key formulation properties and try to push the field forward.”
Nearly two-thirds of all pharmacists in Indiana graduated from Purdue’s College of Pharmacy, which was established in 1884 and is the nation’s third-oldest state-funded school of pharmacy.
The role pharmacists play today in the health care industry continues to grow. Their contributions go beyond a pharmacy as they take up more challenging work such as research and drug discovery. As of 2021, there are 312,550 pharmacists working in the country earning an annual average salary of $125,690.
Like many other pharmacy colleges, Purdue subscribes to the idea of experiential learning within its four-year PharmD curriculum. All told, experiential learning consists of 30% of the curriculum over the span of the entire program.
Students get hands-on experience beginning in their first year and complete different rotations during their four years. And graduates of this program find employment in well-known organizations or can go on to pursue graduate level studies. In addition to the PharmD program for aspiring pharmacists, Purdue also offers a suite of graduate programs, including:
Doctorate in Industrial and Physical Pharmacy
Master in Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology
Master in Pharmacy Practice
Purdue’s pharmacy coursework includes subjects such as pharmacy skills and patient counseling, pathophysiology and drug action, pharmaceutical calculations, integrated pharmacotherapy, dosage forms, health care systems, public health pharmacy, pharmacogenomics, population health management, biotech/advanced parenteral dosage forms, patient safety and informatics, and health policy applications jurisprudence.
During a fourth and final year over a period of 11 months, Purdue pharmacy students participate in 10 four-week rotations at pharmacy settings, providing an opportunity to put knowledge and skills to use while gaining real-world experience.
Another factor in Purdue pharmacy success, students in the program have fared well on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination, or NAPLEX, which is designed to evaluate general practice knowledge by recent graduates for licensing by the boards of pharmacy. Pass rates for the last 10 years by Purdue pharmacy graduates have ranged from a high of 98.7% to 85.7%, with the pass rate above 93% in eight of those years.
Brianna Arinze, who is entering her second year at Purdue, said she chose the university because of its commitment to affordability — and the strength of its pharmacy program. She also had a personal motivation for this career path. When her triplet sister started losing patches of hair at a young age, Arinze felt helpless. Alopecia, an autoimmune disorder that can cause baldness, affects nearly one-third of Black women in the U.S.
“I knew I’d be getting a high-quality education,” Arinze says. “The Purdue pharmacy program has a reputation of being challenging, but I like to be challenged. I also knew I would receive support when I needed it. Purdue seemed like the perfect fit for me.”
In addition, the Purdue college is home to the Center for Medication Safety Advancement and the Center for Pharmaceutical Processing Research. It is the only pharmacy program in the nation with faculty sited abroad and the only program to offer global health and veterinary clinical pharmacy postgraduate residencies.
Purdue clinical assistant professor Jamie Woodyard says she strikes a balance in her classrooms and labs, stressing the value of students learning from their mistakes while underscoring the consequences of errors in dispensing medicine for patients in the real world.
“This approach has helped me connect better with students on a human level,” says Woodyard, a 2011 Purdue PharmD alumna. “It also helps to demonstrate the laboratory as a safe space where students can make mistakes, reflect, acknowledge and learn from them, and then to think through how to prevent these mistakes from occurring again when they are practicing pharmacists.
“I smile a lot in my classes because I truly love what I do. I suppose my secret in pursuing excellence as a teacher is to keep students at the center of everything I do,” Woodyard adds.
Earlier this year, Purdue’s colleges of Pharmacy and Health and Human Sciences announced joint plans for a giant academic leap to advance collaborative, innovative learning for health care professionals in Indiana through a $160 million modern campus facility.
“The Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building is paramount to preparing students to stay on the forefront of our ever-changing health care system and to serve as leaders in their field for generations to come,” Barker says. “The roles of pharmacists and nurses have rapidly changed, with both serving central roles in the delivery of patient care. This hub on Purdue’s campus will help drive students forward in their persistent pursuit of bettering human health.”","[{'summary_text': 'as of 2021, there are 312,550 pharmacists working in the country earning an annual average salary of $125,690 . students in the program have fared well on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination, or NAPLEX .'}]"

"Purdue, IU to collaborate on analysis of Indiana’s $500 million economic development efforts","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue Center for Regional Development, as part of the Office of Engagement, and the Indiana University Public Policy Institute will collaborate on a multiyear project to examine the economic and community impact of Indiana’s nationally recognized, $500 million Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative.
Launched by Gov. Eric Holcomb, the READI program has awarded more than $487 million of the initiative’s original $500 million to accelerate strategic investments in 17 regions that represent all 92 Indiana counties. These funds will match additional public, private and nonprofit dollars, totaling an expected $12.2 billion invested in Indiana communities, talent and innovation.
The project will assess the first iteration of the READI program, from its inception in 2021 through December 31, 2026, to produce key performance indicators and other program insights, including population growth, per capita income and economic impact analyses, for the Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC), which administers READI. The IEDC will allocate $1.69 million over nearly four years to this project to monitor the state’s growth in key areas that contribute to the quality of life of Hoosiers.
“When we announced the READI grant program, we knew it had the potential to have a generational impact across every region and further accelerate population and economic growth throughout Indiana,” said David Rosenberg, Indiana secretary of commerce and CEO of the IEDC. “This partnership with Purdue and IU will put additional data behind these investments in quality of place, quality of life and quality of opportunity, highlighting the significance of each project and program and the state’s unprecedented investment as a whole. Together, we can illustrate Indiana’s commitment to and progress toward creating nationally recognized, vibrant destinations that retain and attract top talent.”

The IEDC announced funding awards December 2021, allocating matching grants to 17 regions ranging in amounts from $5 million to $50 million. These funds will support 361 unique, shovel-ready projects and programs across the state to accelerate community, workforce and economic growth.
“These investments have the potential to really transform the regions of the grant recipients,” said Roberto Gallardo, vice president for engagement and director of the Purdue Center for Regional Development. “In this case, the investment is so significant that I think we really need to go beyond dollars and cents. Community engagement in the program is key to its success.”
Tom Guevara, director of the Indiana University Public Policy Institute, echoed Gallardo’s sentiments, saying the joint research project will deliver tangible, data-driven insight.
“Our work, in partnership with the Purdue Center for Regional Development, will give state leaders and local communities detailed insights for the next several years on how these investments have worked to improve the quality of life and economic future for Hoosiers everywhere,” Guevara said.
Gallardo said the Purdue and IU team will develop a survey to examine the community buy-in for the projects. The research will explore not only how the money is used in the development of capital projects and programs but also how those local efforts are improving the quality of life for residents.
“We want to know if residents are positive about this,” Gallardo said. “With our contribution to the evaluation process, we’ll be helping to tell a powerful story of the impact this program is having in regions throughout the state.”
Gallardo said results will help provide transparency and accountability to state lawmakers, who authorized the $500 million investment, and inform Indiana residents of what’s being done to attract, develop and retain talent in Indiana through capital investments.
Gallardo and Guevara said both partners offer complementary skills and expertise that will allow them to synchronize data and generate creative analyses for the IEDC that, Guevara noted, “can be used for expanding growth and opportunity and providing policy insights that can help leaders make the best decisions for maximum return on public investment.”

Signatures of the Space Age: Spacecraft metals left in the wake of humanity’s path to the stars,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Space Age is leaving fingerprints on one of the most remote parts of the planet — the stratosphere — which has potential implications for climate, the ozone layer and the continued habitability of Earth.
Using tools hitched to the nose cone of their research planes and sampling more than 11 miles above the planet’s surface, researchers have discovered significant amounts of metals in aerosols in the atmosphere, likely from increasingly frequent launches and returns of spacecraft and satellites. That mass of metal is changing atmospheric chemistry in ways that may impact Earth’s atmosphere and ozone layer.
NASA’s Airborne Science Program

College of Science welcomes new department heads from Johns Hopkins and MIT
“We are finding this human-made material in what we consider a pristine area of the atmosphere,” said Dan Cziczo, one of a team of scientists who published a study on these results in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “And if something is changing in the stratosphere — this stable region of the atmosphere — that deserves a closer look.” Cziczo, professor and head of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in Purdue’s College of Science, is an expert in atmospheric science who has spent decades studying this rarefied region.
Led by Dan Murphy, an adjunct professor in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences and a researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the team detected more than 20 elements in ratios that mirror those used in spacecraft alloys. They found that the mass of lithium, aluminum, copper and lead from spacecraft reentry far exceeded those metals found in natural cosmic dust. Nearly 10% of large sulfuric acid particles — the particles that help protect and buffer the ozone layer — contained aluminum and other spacecraft metals.
Scientists estimate that as many as 50,000 more satellites may reach orbit by 2030. The team calculates that means that, in the next few decades, up to half of stratospheric sulfuric acid particles would contain metals from reentry. What effect that could have on the atmosphere, the ozone layer and life on Earth is yet to be understood.
Scientists have long suspected that spacecraft and satellites were changing the upper atmosphere, but studying the stratosphere, where we don’t live and even the highest flights enter only briefly, is challenging.
As part of NASA’s Airborne Science Program, Murphy and his group fly a WB-57 airplane to sample the atmosphere 11.8 miles (19 km) above the ground in Alaska, where circumpolar clouds tend to form. Similar measurements were made by Cziczo and his group from an ER-2 aircraft over the continental United States. Both groups use instruments hitched to the nose cone to ensure that only the freshest, most undisturbed air is sampled.
Like the view of the unruffled surface of the ocean, the stratosphere appears untroubled — at least to human eyes. Life and civilization take place mostly on the planet’s surface and in the troposphere, the atmosphere’s very lowest layer. The stratosphere is a surprisingly stable and seemingly serene layer of the atmosphere.
The stratosphere is also the realm of the ozone layer: that gaseous marvel that acts as a global tent to shield the planet and all life on it from the searing, scorching rays of ultraviolet radiation. Without the ozone layer, life would likely never have arisen on Earth. And without it, life is unlikely to be able to continue.
The last decades have been eventful for the stratosphere. The ozone layer came under threat from chlorofluorocarbons in the 1980s, and only coordinated, sustained global efforts of governments and corporations have begun to bear fruit in repairing and replenishing it.
“Shooting stars streak through the atmosphere,” Cziczo said. “Often, the meteor burns up in the atmosphere and doesn’t even become a meteorite and reach the planet. So the material it was made from stays in the atmosphere in the form of ions. They form very hot gas, which starts to cool and condense as molecules and fall into the stratosphere. The molecules find each other and knit together and form what we call meteorite smoke. Scientists recently started noticing that the chemical fingerprint of these meteoritic particles was starting to change, which made us ask, ‘Well, what changed?’ because meteorite composition hasn’t changed. But the number of spacecraft has.”
Spacecraft launches, and returns, were once international events. The launches of Sputnik and the Mercury missions were front-page news. Now, a quickening tide of innovation and loosening regulation means that dozens of countries and corporations are able to launch satellites and spacecraft into orbit. All those satellites have to be sent up on rockets — and most of that material, eventually, comes back down.
Like the wakes of great ships trolling through the ocean, rockets leave behind them a trail of metals that may change the atmosphere in ways scientists don’t yet understand.
“Just to get things into orbit, you need all this fuel and a huge body to support the payload,” Cziczo said. “There are so many rockets going up and coming back and so many satellites falling back through the atmosphere that it’s starting to show up in the stratosphere as these aerosol particles.”
Of course, shooting stars were the first space-delivery system. Meteorites fall through the atmosphere every day. The heat and friction of the atmosphere peel material off them, just as they do off human-made artifacts. However, while hundreds of meteors enter the Earth’s atmosphere every day, they are increasingly being rivaled by the mass of metals that comprise the tons of Falcon, Ariane and Soyuz rockets that boost spacecraft into space and return again to Earth’s surface.
“Changes to the atmosphere can be difficult to study and complex to understand,” Cziczo said. “But what this research shows us is that the impact of human occupation and human spaceflight on the planet may be significant — perhaps more significant than we have yet imagined. Understanding our planet is one of the most urgent research priorities there is.”

"Purdue Conferences launches Event Design Lab, an engagement and event design center","summarize:Purdue Conferences partnered with Event Design Collective, a Switzerland-based event design company, to establish the Event Design Lab, the world’s first and only lab of its kind in a university. The lab is a space designed to help teams identify, address and overcome project barriers and organizational challenges. Using thoughtful design techniques and interactive tools, teams have space to collaborate, visualize and craft outcome-based events and objectives.
“The vision for bringing an Event Design Lab to the university is to help engage the university and create partnerships with the community,” says Nick Bonora, senior director of engagement and the event design center. “This lab is a place where Boilermakers, community partners and anyone who is interested can come and utilize the lab to plan and organize events.
The lab is located in the Purdue Technology Center, and lab visitors can use the equipment and event canvas design methodology to visualize multiple aspects of an event and purposefully design how stakeholder and attendee behavior could change as a result of the event, thus constructing predictable and measurable impacts and outcomes.
Purdue Conferences regularly hosts training programs in the space, and on Oct. 26, the lab will host a one-day training that introduces the event canvas design methodology and terms to those interested in learning more or applying the methodology to their event, project or organization. Similar trainings are planned to be hosted semiannually in the fall and spring.
The lab was initially developed to design events. Roel Frissen, co-founder of Event Design Collective, and Bonora both envision the canvas design methodology and the lab’s use being extended beyond events to help individuals and organizations create policies, programs and strategic plans around societal impact, workforce and economic development, recruitment and retention, capital campaigns, and fundraising.
Bonora says this unique approach to collaboration could create a broader community of event designers and help the university foster new partnerships.
“I think every society in every location has varying degrees of the same problems, and one of the things about the event design methodology that excites us is the ability to apply a methodology to solve a problem at a local level. The projected design could potentially then be scaled up to a regional level and then a state level and a global level,” Bonora says. “We are fortunate to bring this lab to Purdue, a university that has resources available to help tackle those real-world problems.”
“You learn together with your community, and the community can then start applying the methodology,” Frissen says. “By applying it, you mix the networks, and then the networks can create the change. If we can make that work and prove that it works, that would be pretty phenomenal.”
To learn more about the lab, training and design process, visiting the Event Design Lab training registration or to book the lab, contact Bonora at nbonora@purdue.edu or 765-494-0243.
Purdue Conferences is part of the Administrative Operations organization. The organization supports the university by providing safe, reliable and transformative services. Providing the space and training for the Event Design Lab collaborative space is just one of the transformative services the organization provides to help power Purdue.","[{'summary_text': 'the lab is designed to help teams identify, address and overcome project barriers and organizational challenges . visitors can use the equipment and event canvas design methodology to visualize multiple aspects of an event . similar trainings are planned to be hosted semiannually in the fall and spring .'}]"

ZS Instruments receives $1M grant to develop advanced lithography tech for precision optical encoders,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A Purdue University-connected startup has received federal funding to innovate an industry projected to reach $4.4 billion by 2028. The funding will be used to improve the manufacture of sensors used in semiconductor fabrication and inspection, precision machining equipment, UAV guidance and tracking systems, medical imaging equipment, industrial robots, and measuring instruments.
ZS Systems LLC, dba ZS Instruments, has received a two-year, $1 million Phase II SBIR from the National Science Foundation to develop a novel method to produce high-accuracy optical encoders. Optical encoders are sensors that measure position, either linear or angular, and convert it into an electronic signal.
Modern automation and robotics systems heavily rely on encoders for precision positioning and motion control, said Sergey Zakharov, co-founder of ZS Instruments.
“Increasingly accurate encoders are needed to further innovate and enable the manufacturing of complex next-generation products, such as advanced microchips, high-resolution CT and MRI scanners, UAV guidance and tracking systems, high-accuracy industrial robots, and precision measuring instruments,” he said. “As device miniaturization continues, design specifications become more stringent, and the need to fill the demand for high-precision position sensors and the nano-fabrication technology which enable them becomes paramount.”
Traditional encoder production is a process that introduces defects and errors into encoders and limits their accuracy and resolution. ZS Instruments is working with Alexander V. Kildishev of Purdue’s Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering to develop a novel technology that combines a high-resolution projection lithography system with additive manufacturing to create highly uniform microscopic patterns with extremely low-edge roughness.
“The new approach offers numerous advantages, including economically viable production of precision encoders with sub-nanometer resolution, improved manufacturing yield and shorter lead times,” Zakharov said. “The Phase II research activities encompass the development of a full-size hardware prototype with performance traceable to standards established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. ZS Instruments will also establish the necessary infrastructure to support the newly developed technology.”
Zakharov said applications of the developed tool extend beyond optical encoders into other industry sectors such as semiconductor chip manufacturing, advanced packaging and precision additive manufacturing.
The Phase II grant builds upon research funded by an 18-month, Phase I SBIR grant from the NSF. Kildishev was a sub-awardee; he disclosed information about the innovative tool to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent on the intellectual property. The Phase I prototype has already demonstrated an order of magnitude improvement in both resolution and edge quality.
Sergey and Wei Zakharov co-founded ZS Instruments; Sergey also serves as chief technology officer. He is an alumnus of Purdue’s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Wei is an associate professor and engineering information specialist at Purdue Libraries and School of Information Studies. The company is a client of the Purdue Innovates Incubator, which provides resources to de-risk Purdue-related startups and early-stage technology.
“We have been closely collaborating with the Birck Nanotechnology Center in Discovery Park District at Purdue and will perform parts of the Phase II R&D efforts there,” Sergey Zakharov said. “We also will be establishing a one-of-a-kind precision calibration facility in Lafayette with full traceability to NIST standards.”

The Schrodinger equation, a generalization of the classical Newton’s equation of motion, is the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics that describes the world around us, particularly the structure and dynamics of molecules and materials. This equation can be solved exactly only for small molecular systems. With the current largest supercomputer, we can obtain an exact electronic structure of molecules with only 24 electrons. This limits us from obtaining accurate descriptions of possible outcomes of chemical reactions. However, quantum computing is widely expected to solve valuable problems that today’s computers cannot.
Perturbation theory is a useful systematic mathematical method to obtain an approximate solution to such an equation. It has been one of the most used methods for chemical calculations for over 50 years. With the recent advances in quantum computing algorithms, the question is how to implement perturbation methods on quantum devices.
In this study, led by Sabre Kais at Purdue University and Barbara Joes at IBM, researchers presented, for the first time, a general quantum circuit performing perturbation calculations and implemented the method on IBM’s quantum hardware.","[{'summary_text': 'study led by Sabre Kais, Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University . used a quantum computer to perform chemical calculations via perturbation theory . could be used to solve quantum mechanics problems on a larger scale .'}]"

CEO Nick Gunady said Aerovy has closed its round of pre-seed funding, raising $800,000 from Purdue Innovates, M25 and the Flywheel Fund.
“The closing of the pre-seed round represents a critical milestone in our missions to unlock the energy equation for AAM and airport electrification,” Gunady said. “This will allow us to deploy to our customers and partners worldwide.”
Gunady said Aerovy is planning a round of seed funding in 2024.
Tyler Mantel, director, Ventures, Purdue Innovates, said, “Purdue has long been at the forefront of innovation in aviation, and we are proud to play a role in nurturing the groundbreaking technology behind Aerovy. Investing $200,000 into their fundraising round was not just a vote of confidence in their vision, but a testament to our belief in their potential to revolutionize energy demand management.”
Mike Asem, founding partner of M25, said, “We could not be more excited to join Nick Gunady and the Aerovy team on their exciting journey to enable the future of mobility. After many conversations with the team, as well as elite industry experts abroad, it is clear that Aerovy has unique technology with full potential to be a core component of the next wave of transportation infrastructure. As a Purdue alumnus myself, in addition to M25’s focus on startups in the Midwest, we couldn’t be happier about investing in this game-changing technology out of West Lafayette.”
Brian Hatton, venture partner at Flywheel Fund, said, “Flywheel is excited to support Nick Gunady and the Aerovy team with their mission to help the aeronautics industry plan for, monitor and optimize their clean energy production. We are observing dramatic changes in the energy industry and in the possibilities for electric air travel, with Aerovy at the nexus of the two. Our focus on supporting entrepreneurs in Indiana and the Midwest is really shining through with the investment in this game-changing technology.”
Gunady also announced an expanded partnership between Aerovy and Electro Base, a leading provider of battery container technology. Electro Base is a subsidiary of Electro.Aero, an electric aviation charging technology company based in Perth, Australia. Aerovy and Electro.Aero had established a partnership in early 2023.
“Our continued partnership with Electro.Aero and this new strategic relationship with Electro Base highlights our commitment to advancing the charging landscape for AAM and beyond,” Gunady said in a previous news story. “We’re excited about the possibilities this collaboration unlocks for the future of sustainable transportation.”
Aerovy had previously established worldwide partnerships with Altaport, an automation software company based in Salt Lake City, and SkyScape, a developer of vertiport infrastructure based in Osaka, Japan.
“Through this partnership with SkyScape, Aerovy will deploy cloud software solutions to the Integrated Aviation Center in Hokkaido, Japan,” Gunady said. “Aerovy has additional plans to deploy around the world, including to sites in Paris, Singapore, Dubai and California.”
Gunady said Aerovy also has recently launched additional new partnerships with Apricus Energy Partners and Volatus Infrastructure & Energy Solutions. He said the company is open to additional industrial collaborations.
Aerovy has developed AATLAS and VEMS, two software solutions that address obstacles to advanced air mobility: power grid limitations and operations.
“The AATLAS planning software identifies locations that would attract the most demand, so operators would be able to make back their investments quickly,” Gunady said. “It also assesses the expected usage over time, simulating charging events minute by minute throughout the day. We can size power generation and storage assets, which enables end users to reduce dependence on the grid.”
VEMS operational software automatically connects users with all their assets at infrastructure sites, including chargers and off-grid energy systems.
“Customers will have full control over their infrastructure site without physically needing to be there,” Gunady said. “We have built automation tools to remotely connect with aircraft, charge vehicles, minimize grid cost and dynamically price without any user input.”
Aerovy’s cloud-based software suite is based on work by Purdue graduate and undergraduate students, including Gunady, who is an alumnus of Purdue’s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics and research assistant in Purdue’s Center for Integrated Systems in Aerospace. The team won the 2022 Smart Connected Aviation Student Competition, a Federal Aviation Administration contest, with its entry “Advanced Air Mobility as an Electric Grid Demand Response Asset.”
Gunady and his team disclosed the software innovations to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which applied for intellectual property protection for the work. OTC issued Aerovy an exclusive license to manufacture and sell the technologies.
Aerovy is a U.S.-based startup developing a suite of cloud-based software solutions for electrical infrastructure planning and operations management in the advanced air mobility sector. With a mission to drive innovation in electric aviation, Aerovy’s software optimizes energy usage and enhances the sustainability of electric aircraft charging systems.

Purdue community and No. 6 graduate program attracts aerospace engineers across continents,"summarize:About This Series: This story is part of an ongoing Purdue Today series highlighting programs ranked in the Top 10 or Top 10th percentile among our peers nationally, demonstrating the university’s persistent pursuit of excellence, innovation and transformative learning.
Rodrigo Schmitt has been transformed at Purdue University. Moving to Indiana from Brazil was a big step, but he wanted a doctorate in aerospace engineering — and he wanted it from the best school possible. He had joined a rocketry club while pursuing his undergraduate degrees in astronomy and physics, and it lit a fire in him.
“It made me realize that if I wanted to be at the cutting edge of space exploration, I needed to be in a place that was pushing those boundaries — and the United States is the leader in aerospace advancements,” Schmitt says.
The Gambaro Graduate Program of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue was a top contender in Schmitt’s comparisons, with its aerospace engineering graduate program ranked No. 6 by U.S. News & World Report in its 2023 survey released in April.
When Schmitt began digging, what he saw went far deeper.
“Purdue isn’t just about academics. It’s a community that encourages a holistic educational experience,” he says. “Overall, the combination of top-tier education, cutting-edge research opportunities and a vibrant community made Purdue the ideal choice for my graduate studies.”

Purdue Center for Integrated Systems in Aerospace
Schmitt is now feeding his intellectual curiosity in the Center for Integrated Systems in Aerospace (CISA), building an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model that could make space missions easier to design and run.
“XAI helps engineers make better decisions. It’s like having a supersmart assistant that goes beyond suggesting what to do by explaining why it makes sense to do it that way,” he says. “We’re using this technology to build a new framework that could assist in planning more frequent trips to the moon while spending less money than we did for the old Apollo missions.”
Schmitt finds that work exhilarating and demanding — he says it has given him the rigor needed to earn his PhD. But, as he suspected, he’s found more at Purdue than academic excellence.
“The most transformative experience I’ve had at Purdue — perhaps even in my life — has been creating and developing the first organization at Purdue dedicated to human space exploration: the Space & Earth Analogs Research Chapter (SEARCH). The accomplishments we’ve made so far reflect what can only be achieved by an exceptional team of passionate students and advisors sharing the same hopes and dreams,” he says.
The club has attracted guest speakers from NASA’s Johnson Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Mars Society, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin. They also supported Purdue’s mission to the Mars Desert Research Station in January 2023.
Despite having traveled to another continent, Schmitt also found warmth at Purdue.
“AAE has been incredibly welcoming to me, both as an international student and as a Brasileiro. The department goes above and beyond to foster an inclusive environment. For example, their Minority Engineering Program specifically reaches out to support students from diverse backgrounds, including Latinos,” he says.
“But it’s not just about existing programs; it’s about a willingness to grow and adapt. The faculty and staff are open to discussions about how they can better serve the Latin American student community, which I find exceptionally comforting. They’ve even organized sessions to discuss ways to make students from this region feel more at home, thousands of miles away from their native countries.”
Schmitt’s experience is only a partial reflection of the enormous scope of opportunities available in this program.
“One of the great features of our graduate program is our close connection to both government and industry,” says AAE professor Jon Poggie. “Right now, my graduate students are working on projects sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory, the Army Research Laboratory and the Stratolaunch company. Our close connection to the technical staff at these institutions gives insight into how our academic research supports applications and provides an exciting atmosphere of collaboration on cutting-edge technology.”
Joe Jewell, the John Bogdanoff Associate Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, says the program benefits from being both balanced and comprehensive.
“It’s truly an example of excellence at scale. Purdue pursued hypersonic work — now recognized as absolutely critical — even during the leaner decades of research funding in this area. As a result, Purdue now has world-leading capabilities in low-disturbance ‘quiet’ wind tunnels, high-enthalpy reflected shock/expansion tunnels and hypersonic measurement technology,” he says.
“What’s more, we also have the computational expertise to pull all of it together and link it to flight test programs and real-world challenges.”
William Crossley, the Uhrig and Vournas Head of Aeronautics and Astronautics, says AAE’s program is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the world, with research facilities that are unrivaled. Crossley cites:
Maurice J. Zucrow Laboratories as the world’s largest academic propulsion labs.
The Purdue UAS Research and Test Facility (PURT), the world’s largest indoor motion-capture facility, doing UAS and autonomy research with world-class precision.
The world’s only Mach 6 quiet wind tunnel and an even faster one under construction, alongside yet another matches enthalpy conditions up to 25 times the speed of sound
“We also have advanced manufacturing, large-scale additive manufacturing, composites and digital twin research for aerospace at HAMTC and CMSC. And those are just some of our laboratories,” says Crossley, referring to the Hypersonics Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center and Composites Manufacturing and Simulation Center.
“Combine those with faculty that are internationally recognized in their fields — like our professors working on spacecraft trajectories for Earth orbit, for Cislunar space and for interplanetary exploration, as just one example — and it’s easy to see why we continue to attract the best grad students from around the world.”","[{'summary_text': 'the Gambaro graduate program of aeronautics and astronomy at Purdue was ranked No. 6 by U.S. News & World Report in its 2023 survey released in April . the program is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the world, with research facilities that are unrivaled . professor: ""the most transformative experience i\'ve had at purdue — perhaps even in my life — was creating and developing the first organization at Purue dedicated to human space exploration""'}]"
Purdue survey delves into brand-name food and beverage preferences of consumers,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Most consumers would choose brand-name beverages over generic or store-brand beverages, according to the September 2023 Consumer Food Insights Report. The report further indicates that consumers make this choice even when presented with a sizable price discount on generic or store brand names.
The survey-based report out of Purdue University’s Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability assesses food spending, consumer satisfaction and values, support of agricultural and food policies, and trust in information sources. Purdue experts conducted and evaluated the survey, which included 1,200 consumers across the U.S.
In contrast to beverage choices, most survey respondents said they were unwilling to pay a premium for brand-name meat or fruits and vegetables. The findings in the report’s “Brand Beliefs” section were based on new questions that yielded some interesting results, said the report’s lead author Joseph Balagtas, professor of agricultural economics and director of CFDAS at Purdue.
“When it comes to snack foods, consumer choice is price sensitive,” Balagtas said. “A majority of consumers tell us that brand-name products taste better. And even when generics are 15% cheaper, a majority choose the brand-name product. But if generics are 30% cheaper, a majority of consumers will choose the generic brand.”
To dig deeper into why consumers might or might not choose brand-name food, the survey included follow-up questions that gathered consumer beliefs about brand-name versus generic or store-brand foods.
“We find that taste is positively correlated with the decision to choose brand-name foods over cheaper substitutes,” Balagtas said. Consumers perceive brand-name beverages to taste better than generics and thus are more likely to purchase branded products even at a premium. But fewer consumers believe that brands are associated with better taste in the meat and fruit and vegetable aisles, and thus fewer are willing to pay a premium for those products.
“Across all food categories, most consumers do not believe that brand-name foods are more nutritious or made from better ingredients or safer than store brands,” Balagtas said. “Our finding that taste is the main driver of consumers’ valuation of brand names is consistent with results from our food values survey questions, where respondents consistently rank taste as the most important attribute when shopping for food.”
Additional key results from the September report include:
Households making less than $50,000 were more price sensitive when presented with two generic or store-brand discounts.
The consumer food inflation estimate (6.3%) continues to diverge from the government consumer price index of food inflation (4.3%).
“We see that brand choices differ slightly when disaggregated by income,” said Elijah Bryant, a survey research analyst at the center and co-author of the report. “Those who make less than $50,000 are more responsive to changes in the price of their food options.”
While consumers with the lowest income already tend to choose generic brands over brand names, this disparity grows when the discount on generic or store-brand foods is doubled from 15% to 30%.
In the food expenditures category, Bryant noted a slight decrease in average food-away-from-home (FAFH) spending, which has gone down since June. “This could be a result of FAFH inflation cooling at a slower rate than food-at-home inflation, meaning a dollar goes further for consumers at the grocery store than it does at restaurants,” he said.
Total weekly food spending has increased by 1.6% since last September, which is below the government’s food inflation estimate of 4.3%. This suggests that consumers might either be buying slightly less food or more affordable food options relative to last year, Bryant said.
Food security remained under the 2022 average of 15% this month (13%), dropping slightly from last month (14%). “Consumers continue to be happy with their diets and lives as a whole, though lower-income households tend to be less happy with their diets and lives than those in higher-income households,” Bryant said.
The Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability is part of Purdue’s Next Moves in agriculture and food systems and uses innovative data analysis shared through user-friendly platforms to improve the food system. In addition to the Consumer Food Insights Report, the center offers a portfolio of online dashboards.","[{'summary_text': 'most consumers would choose brand-name beverages over generic or store-brand beverages, according to the September 2023 Consumer Food Insights Report . most survey respondents said they were unwilling to pay a premium for brand name meat or fruits and vegetables . fewer consumers believe brands are associated with better taste in the meat and fruit and vegetable aisles .'}]"

President Chiang continues 92-county Indiana tour with visit to northern part of state,"summarize:Purdue President Mung Chiang is set to make the next round of visits on his statewide tour of Indiana’s 92 counties Oct. 9.
Chiang’s visit to the northern part of the state includes Lake, Porter, Starke, St. Joseph, Elkhart, Marshall, Fulton and Pulaski counties. It marks his seventh statewide tour, which began in August 2022, with each visit covering five to eight counties.
Purdue Extension, which has offices in every Indiana county and operates in the College of Agriculture, has coordinated most of the president’s visits. Extension offices provide an opportunity for Indiana residents to connect with Purdue’s network of resources, research and experts in agriculture, community, environment, family, food and youth.
During his visits, Chiang meets with groups of community leaders to discuss how Purdue can be the most useful partner and neighbor in agriculture, health, youth development and economic growth. These areas directly relate to Purdue’s “ABCD” plan to serve the state and the country through four initiatives: Airport for the Greater Lafayette region, Broadband for rural counties, (hard-tech) Corridor for central Indiana, and Purdue@DC, which brings unique capabilities to our nation’s capital.
As each county has its own unique opportunities and challenges, Chiang also listens to stories of success and concerns from county leaders to further understand how Purdue can help support and foster continued growth and prosperity through Extension resources and activities.
Chiang is continuing to schedule additional tours in 2023-24. By visiting all 92 counties, he hopes to reaffirm Purdue’s place as the state’s land-grant institution and the trusted resource for the entire state of Indiana.","[{'summary_text': ""president Mung Chiang is set to make the next round of visits on his statewide tour of Indiana's 92 counties on Oct. 9 . it marks his seventh tour, which began in august 2022, with each visit covering five to eight counties .""}]"
"Purdue launches broadband team, effort to increase high-speed internet access, adoption and use throughout Indiana","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University continues to fulfill its land-grant responsibilities, this time by serving the state in its broadband initiative. Through its presence in every county in the state, the university is taking a leading role to help ensure all Indiana families and businesses have access to affordable broadband internet service — which is crucial for success in the 21st century — while also helping to ensure data accuracy that will help the state of Indiana in deploying the $868 million in federal funding from the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program for high-speed internet improvements.
Purdue President Mung Chiang announced on Monday (Oct. 9) the launch of the Purdue Broadband Team, a collaborative effort between Purdue, the Indiana Broadband Office, and the Indiana Office of Community and Rural Affairs. Coordinated by Purdue’s Office of Engagement, the Purdue Broadband Team will include Purdue Extension, 4-H, the Purdue Center for Regional Development and the Purdue for Life Foundation.
“The lack of affordable high-speed broadband affects economic development and quality of life in various communities in our state,” Chiang said. “Continuing our long-standing tradition as Indiana’s land-grant institution, Purdue is honored to play a small and hopefully useful role as the state government plans the next-level broadband deployment.”

The Purdue Broadband Team focuses on raising awareness of available tools but does not have oversight on the speed test outcomes or challenges submitted. And while it is obviously not a service provider or infrastructure builder, it will work with communities in education about the ways to use broadband for businesses and families
The announcement was made as Chiang continued toward his goal to visit all 92 Indiana counties. During his tour, Chiang has seen firsthand and heard from residents, community leaders and business owners what impact insufficient broadband can have on a community. By visiting every region of the state, he says he hopes to send a message that Purdue is a resource for addressing challenges, including bridging the digital divide.
“It is part of our mission as a land-grant university to use resources, knowledge and scope of reach to aid in this critical endeavor,” Chiang said. “Broadband means better health care, better schools, stronger infrastructure and more jobs for people to choose from. This is about translating why it matters and helping make that linkage for people in communities.”
Working at a community level, the Purdue Broadband Team will help residents, businesses and local leaders expand broadband access, adoption and use by:
Increasing awareness of:

Tools to verify service, including tools for community members to conduct speed tests and validate broadband service maps.
Programs (state and federal) to expand broadband access.
Tools to verify service, including tools for community members to conduct speed tests and validate broadband service maps.
Programs (state and federal) to expand broadband access.
Providing training to residents and businesses on digital literacy.
Supporting community-led broadband task forces/working groups.
With this mission, the Purdue Broadband Team is launching at a critical time, when the state of Indiana has made expansion of broadband service a top priority.
“Access to fast, reliable internet is a major contributor to quality of life and is one of the great equalizers in today’s society,” said Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch, Indiana’s secretary of agriculture and rural development. “I applaud Purdue’s commitment to investing in broadband by educating Hoosiers on tools to improve their own broadband access. As a state, we have seen a direct connection between the number of people requesting broadband services in a certain area and the areas providers are most likely to invest in. I am confident that this partnership with Purdue will accelerate state efforts to ensure that all Hoosiers, in every community, will have broadband access.”
The Purdue Broadband Team will be led by Roberto Gallardo, Purdue vice president for engagement and director of the Purdue Center for Regional Development, and include Purdue Extension personnel, students, 4-H members and alumni.
Gallardo says the core component of this initiative is for team members to educate the public and spread the word with family, friends and colleagues about the importance of broadband in their local communities.
“Purdue is a long-standing and trusted partner across Indiana. With those community relationships, we want to increase awareness about the tools that are available to improve high-speed broadband access, adoption and use by making broadband data more accurate,” Gallardo said.
The Federal Communications Commission map is a key metric in determining where funding is allocated for broadband projects. Gallardo said the more accurate the data at the local level, the better the chances for resources to reach unserved and underserved areas of Indiana.
“Accurate and up-to-date information is a critical piece of the puzzle. Local broadband groups and the state can run into challenges with the data that is needed to support grant applications,” Gallardo said. “For broadband funding to be allocated to Hoosier communities needing it the most, data must accurately reflect gaps in broadband connectivity.”
Helping communities to improve the quality of available broadband data is just one of many efforts that the Purdue Broadband Team will undertake to help Indiana close the digital divide.

Purdue Applied Research Institute joins Abt Associates-led team in $49 million USAID climate initiative,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue Applied Research Institute (PARI) has partnered with Abt Associates, a global consulting and research firm, on a $49 million award from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to help nations meet the climate commitments they made under the Paris Agreement.
The award is part of USAID’s five-year Comprehensive Action for Climate Change Initiative (CACCI), the agency’s global flagship program to create actionable programs and policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
“PARI Global Development and Innovation is excited to be a part of this important project with Abt Associates and USAID,” said John Glover, executive director for PARI GDI. “Our mission is to provide innovation and applied research approaches to develop practical policy solutions for the very complex systemic issues climate change poses, such as food security, community adaptation and resiliency as well as impacts of increased displacements and a greater need for humanitarian assistance as natural disasters from weather events occur.”
Through collaboration with Abt Associates, PARI’s partnering researchers in the College of Agriculture will receive $800,000 with potential for further support for their work over CACCI’s duration.
“This is an exciting initiative to address climate change challenges and policies across the globe,” said Gerald Shively, associate dean and director of International Programs in Agriculture. “We are pleased to be partnering with PARI, Abt Associates and others, and look forward to leveraging the expertise of the College of Agriculture to ensure the project’s success.”
Purdue researchers will work to address several of CACCI’s objectives by collaborating with Abt Associates on the generation of information and data to meet the needs of policymakers, calling on CGIAR, fellow U.S. land-grant universities, historically Black colleges and universities, and think tanks as needed.
“Climate change is a threat to all and challenges us to innovate in key areas: mitigation, adaptation and resilience,” said Matthew Huber, the David E. Ross Director of the Purdue Institute for a Sustainable Future and professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences. “We are pleased to be part of this project, working with terrific partners. The project aligns exactly with ISF’s mission to foster and promote research, partnerships and engagement in areas including the environment, climate impacts and resilience, food-energy-water security, human and biosphere health, and sustainability as broadly defined by the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.”
Abt Associates will also look to Purdue’s agricultural researchers for assistance in engaging with agribusiness sector associates in land and natural resource usage, and in planning for adaptation and mitigation, particularly in cocoa and coffee cultivation.
“Abt has spent decades working with municipalities to develop localized policy solutions, including in response to the climate crisis,” said Jenn Cisse, Abt Associates’ director for climate adaptation and resilience. “Collectively — with IISD (International Institute for Sustainable Development), Purdue and WRI (World Resources Institute) — this team has almost 100 years of experience supporting policy reforms and connecting stakeholders working on climate policy and action in more than 150 countries. We’re thrilled to harness this team’s know-how with that of our partner countries. We applaud USAID for their vision because activities of this scale are essential to ensuring global progress on climate adaptation and mitigation.”",[{'summary_text': 'the award is part of USAID’s five-year Comprehensive Action for Climate Change Initiative (CACCI) the agency’s flagship program to create actionable programs and policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change .'}]
Predicting prostate cancer recurrence 15 months faster,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A Purdue University mechanical engineer and his international collaborators have developed a patent-pending method and algorithm to predict the recurrence of prostate cancer in patients treated by radiation therapy.­
Hector Gomez, a professor in Purdue University’s School of Mechanical Engineering, said data indicates the model-based predictors can identify relapsing patients a median of 14.8 months earlier than the current clinical practice.
Gomez said radiation is an effective treatment for patients of all ages to treat tumors ranging in risk from low to very high. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, between 20% to 30% of patients will experience a recurrence after the five-year period, post-therapy.
“The detection of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation relies on the measurement of a sustained rise of the serum levels of a substance called prostate-specific antigen, or PSA,” Gomez said. “However, the recurrence may take years to occur, which delays the delivery of a secondary treatment to patients with recurring tumors.”
Gomez and his collaborators at the University of Pavia in Italy and the University of Castilla — La Mancha in Spain have developed novel, patient-specific forecasts of PSA dynamics to predict cancer recurrence. Their research has been published online in iScience, an open access journal.
The algorithm is based on a patient-specific mechanistic model, informed by the periodic PSA measurements for an individual patient. These measurements are part of the standard monitoring for prostate cancer patients who have undergone radiation.
“The PSA data is used in conjunction with the model to obtain patient-specific parameters that determine the PSA dynamics and serve as classifiers for recurrence,” Gomez said. “In addition to recurrence identification, our model can be used for designing personalized PSA monitoring strategies. It can tell physicians the right time to investigate tumor recurrences and maximize the window of curability.”
Gomez and his collaborators tested the method using retrospective data from a cohort of 166 patients.
“For each of these patients, we compared the time when our model first identified the recurrence with the standard medical practice,” Gomez said. “We found that our method predicted recurrence a median of 14.8 months earlier.”
Gomez said the model will be further developed to expand the population of patients who can benefit from it.
“Our current model can be used only for patients who do not receive any treatment additional to radiation,” Gomez said. “Some patients receive radiation and hormone therapy simultaneously and cannot benefit from our method right now. We plan to extend the method to make it applicable also to patients who receive radiation and hormone therapy simultaneously.”
Gomez disclosed the innovation to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in developing and commercializing the innovation should contact Patrick Finnerty, senior business development and licensing manager in life sciences, at pwfinnerty@prf.org.
Hector Gomez is among the Purdue University faculty whose work is supported by the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research.
“There is an important need for prognostic technology like Hector’s to be further developed to begin to predict which prostate cancer patients are at high risk so they can be followed more closely and monitored to verify the recurrence,” said Timothy Ratliff, former director of the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research and Distinguished Professor of Comparative Pathobiology in the College of Veterinary Medicine. “I am proud that Purdue University has outstanding organizations like the Institute for Cancer Research that bring together faculty to generate new technologies that impact people’s lives.”
In its Cancer Facts & Figures 2023 report, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 288,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2023.
It estimates more than 34,000 American men will die from prostate cancer in 2023.
Early-stage prostate cancer usually shows no symptoms. The five-year survival rate of men with distant-stage disease is 32%.

"Purdue trustees approve land transfers to support student organizations, future campus development","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University trustees on Friday (Oct. 6) approved several real estate deals.
In a land transfer with the Wesley Foundation at Purdue University, Purdue will acquire 0.44 acres of land at 435 Mitch Daniels Blvd. — adjacent to the Krannert Building and Krannert Center for Executive Education and Research. The Wesley Foundation has owned and operated its facility at that site since 1917. The foundation’s new location at 122 Waldron St. will enable one of the longest-tenured community service organizations to maintain a presence near campus while placing an additional cultural organization in the south Waldron neighborhood.
Trustees also approved the purchase of 0.61 acres of land at 402 Waldron St. in West Lafayette from Chi Omega sorority. Additionally, land located at 509, 519 and 523 Waldron St. and 1005 Sixth St. in West Lafayette will be ground leased at market rate for a period of 40 years to Chi Omega, which intends to build a new sorority house. The current property will be leased back to Chi Omega during construction.
This transaction maintains one of the longest-tenured sororities at a near-campus location, creates vibrancy and positive student life impacts in the north Waldron neighborhood, allows the university to own a property at an important strategic location and aligns with the 2018 Giant Leaps Master Plan, which identifies this location as a potential site for future campus development.
“Through our discussions and partnerships with the Wesley Foundation and the Chi Omega sorority, we were able to identify solutions that benefit both long-standing service organizations while also providing space for the growing Daniels School of Business,” said Michael B. Cline, senior vice president for administrative operations.
In other action, trustees approved the lease of 55 apartments from Fuse for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 academic years to provide additional student housing capacity to meet projected enrollment demands on the West Lafayette campus. The apartments include 173 beds for student housing and two beds for residential assistants.
Located at 720 Northwestern Ave., Fuse is a five-story, 355,000-square-foot retail and housing facility that includes 489 beds in 228 one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom and four-bedroom apartments. The total lease commitment of $4,585,746 will be funded by Auxiliary Funds-Housing/Dining.

Trustees updated on Purdue’s Next Moves initiatives,"summarize:During their meeting Friday (Oct. 6), Purdue University trustees were updated on five of the university’s Next Moves initiatives.
Purdue’s Next Moves were launched in April 2021 to advance the university’s competitive advantage in its continuing quest to lead the world’s top research and teaching institutions.
President Chiang’s Board of Trustees presentation
Here are the updates, based on Friday’s presentations:
Purdue Agriculture is leading our world into the future by using data and technology to improve the productivity, resilience and nutritional value of plants in changing environments. Plant Sciences 2.0 makes investments in digital forestry, a new phenotyping greenhouse facility and data sciences, the Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability, and commercialization through Ag-Celerator.
The new phenotyping greenhouse will support research and discoveries in plant health, nutrition, drought and disease stress, and root health while enabling integration into Purdue’s controlled-environment phenotyping facility; in September ground was broken on the facility.
The Institute for Digital Forestry has also made progress in its goal to measure every tree and crop on the planet, mapping the location of 273,485,688 trees in 330-plus cities nationwide and 3,341,088 trees on 137,970 acres in Indianapolis. It has engaged at Purdue with 15 departments or schools in Agriculture, Engineering, Libraries, Science and the Polytechnic Institute. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also has issued a $10 million grant, “Promoting Economic Resilience and Sustainability of the Eastern U.S. Forests,” with Purdue as the lead, and a $9 million grant, “Engaging Family Forests To Improve Climate-Smart Commodities,” with Purdue as the subcontractor.
The National Security and Technology Initiative focuses on hypersonic and space vehicles, energetic materials and systems, cybersecurity, and secure microelectronics. Purdue has secured several new partnerships in these areas, including with the Office of Naval Research and the Air Force Research Laboratory Regional Hub Network.
In addition, the Defense Civilian Training Corps is a new program for undergraduate students that builds civilian careers in the U.S. Department of Defense related to acquisitions, digital technologies, critical technologies, science, engineering, finance and more. Purdue is one of four universities selected to pilot the program, which hosts a cohort of 20 students who receive scholarship-for-civilian-service awards. For the first time ever, Purdue’s largest source of sponsored research awards came from the Department of Defense; the DOD also recently selected eight Microelectronics Commons Hubs. Indiana is home to the largest hub in the Silicon Heartland, with Purdue as the lead university.
Areas of focus for the Purdue Applied Research Institute include technology acceleration through the Digital Innovation in Agri-food Systems Laboratory, national security and technology, global development and innovation, and infrastructure research and innovative solutions. PARI’s executive leadership team recently met to refine its business model, operating assumptions and future organizational structure. Additions have been made to the research team, and new facilities such as the Hypersonics and Applied Research Facility and a permanent presence at WestGate Academy contribute to PARI’s mission. Several partnerships have also developed, including one with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division.
Purdue seeks to offer the most innovative residential learning program in the United States among large research universities. By the end of the fall 2023 semester, 5,000 students will have access to EduNav, a smart, personalized degree-planning tool that allows them to select from multiple, optimized scenarios while planning the sequencing of their courses according to their goals. Designed to support student decision-making and time to degree, EduNav will be available to most of Purdue’s West Lafayette undergraduate students by the spring of 2024.
In a continued effort to support a dynamic portfolio of high-value degrees and programs, the institutional processes for launching new degrees, majors and certificates have been simplified, reducing the number of forms and distinct approval steps and resulting in a faster and more efficient process. An estimated 1,500 hours have been saved in faculty time each academic year. Institutional process improvements have also been made that will provide more transparency regarding degree requirements for students.
The mission of the Equity Task Force is to develop a plan with specific actions to ensure all members of the Purdue community can equitably experience all the university has to offer. The task force seeks to increase Black student applications over the next three to five years with a plan to identify and target metropolitan areas; cultivate authentic relationships with high schools and communities; engage alumni; create and increase on-campus activities; expose students to college life; and create hands-on activities in robotics, math and science. The Purdue Marketing and Communications team will promote these plans during campus visits, at college fairs, on precollege pathways, to student transfers, to Purdue Polytechnic High Schools students, and at Purdue regional campuses and neighboring community colleges.

Trustees approve Chiang’s performance metrics for 2023-24,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University’s Board of Trustees on Friday (Oct. 6) approved the metrics on which President Mung Chiang’s performance will be measured for the 2023-24 fiscal year, the first performance metrics of his presidency.
The goals and metrics will be annually reviewed and revised by the board, as they were for Chiang’s predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and will define and measure progress in five priority areas, according to trustee Malcolm DeKryger, chair of the board’s Compensation Committee, which recommended the metrics for board approval.
“Our university continues to make giant leaps forward in all aspects, thanks to our outstanding faculty, staff and students, led by an administration that sees opportunity at every corner,” DeKryger said. “We continue to set high goals to ensure our university remains at the top of institutions of higher education to the benefit of our students, our state and our world.”
Upon his selection as Purdue’s 13th president, Chiang requested his contract follow the same structure as Daniels’ before him, with a substantial portion of the pay being at risk and determined based on annual performance, and that his starting base salary be less than Daniels’ and less than his then-base salary as faculty.
Metrics will measure progress for 2023-24 in:
Financial success (18%): Factors include a favorable operating budget, fundraising dollars and number of donors.
Student success (32%): Factors include starting salary of graduates, four- and six-year graduation rates, success of programs such as the Dr. Cornell A. Bell Business Opportunity Program and Minority Engineering Program, percentage of Pell Grant recipients in undergraduate enrollment, systemwide number of graduates of all degrees, and Purdue University Online enrollment.
Research (20%): Factors include external research funding amount, number of active industry partners, number of patents filed, and Purdue Applied Research Institute operational and facility readiness.
Reputation (10%): Factors include the composite of three national rankings — U.S. News & World Report undergraduate rankings and the U.S. portion of QS and Times Higher Education rankings — and the number of earned media placements.
University initiatives (20%): Factors include Purdue University in Indianapolis transition readiness, Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business top faculty recruits, Purdue Global business success plan, and other significant achievements, such as those related to Purdue Computes or Purdue’s Next Moves.

Purdue trustees approve renaming Veterans Success Center to Dorothy Stratton Veteran and Military Success Center,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Dorothy Stratton’s legacy and leadership to Purdue University and the nation will be recognized with the renaming of the Veterans Success Center on the West Lafayette campus to the Dorothy Stratton Veteran and Military Success Center. Purdue trustees approved the renaming Friday (Oct. 6).
In addition to honoring Stratton, the center’s name now includes the word “Military” to reflect a more inclusive space, as veterans represent the smallest percentage in Purdue’s overall military-connected student population. The center’s largest population is family members using benefits that are transferred from a veteran family member.
A rededication ceremony is scheduled for Nov. 10.
Stratton became the first full-time dean of women at Purdue in 1933 and served in that role until 1942, when she was commissioned a senior lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. Later in 1942, she was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard, where she became the creator and first director of its Women’s Reserve in World War II. Upon being named director, she was promoted to lieutenant commander and then to commander in January 1944 and to captain one month later.
The nautical title SPAR, as the Women’s Reserve was commonly known, was originated by Stratton. She coined the acronym from the first letters of the Coast Guard’s famous fighting motto, “Semper paratus,” and its English translation, “Always ready.”
Upon her retirement in 1946, Stratton was awarded the Legion of Merit medal for her contributions to women in the military.
From 1947-50, Stratton was director of personnel at the International Monetary Fund, and she was national executive director of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America from 1950-60.
During her tenure at Purdue, Stratton saw the enrollment of women students increase from 500 to more than 1,400, and three modern residence halls for women constructed. A liberal science program for women in the School of Science was inaugurated, and an employment placement center for Purdue women was instituted. She was instrumental in establishing the Housemother Training School, which gave intensive training to several hundred fraternity and sorority housemothers from all parts of the country.
The Veterans Success Center provides holistic programming and services for Purdue’s military-connected students who are veterans, current service members or family members. Currently more than 1,700 military-connected students using service-connected education benefits are served by the center.
Stratton died in 2006 at age 107.

DOE funds 3D printing of wind blade tooling to make U.S. clean energy sector more competitive,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Wind energy is a vital component of a portfolio of clean, sustainable power. Those slow-moving turbine blades you see rotating at wind farms are constructed largely manually, and low-cost labor keeps most of this manufacturing industry abroad. Strengthening and perpetuating this essential sector in the United States can be achieved only through automation, which will enable cost-efficient production and broaden adoption of wind power in the U.S.
To that end, the U.S. Department of Energy has announced an award of $2,849,000 to the Composites Manufacturing Simulation Center of Purdue University and its industry partners, Thermwood Inc., TPI Composites Inc., Dassault Systèmes, Dimensional Innovations and Techmer PM.

Ceremonial groundbreaking marks beginning of University Hall renovation,"summarize:Purdue held a groundbreaking ceremony Saturday (Sept. 30) on Memorial Mall to launch the renovation and restoration of University Hall.
The private event featured remarks from Purdue President Mung Chiang, Purdue historian John Norberg and David A. Reingold, senior vice president for policy planning and Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts.
“The 2023 Homecoming ceremony to restore the oldest standing building on campus, University Hall, is also a rededication of our support to the study of humanities, the arts and social sciences at Purdue, where our faculty, staff and students continue to carry out top notch research and learning in these areas essential to our university,” President Chiang said. “Our respect to the rich history of University Hall is matched with resources to create new student-centered spaces.”
Opened in 1877 and partly funded through John Purdue’s founding donation, University Hall has been used for classrooms, was home to Purdue’s first library and a chapel and once served as the president’s office. The building was last remodeled in 1961.
“With this project, we honor University Hall, Purdue University’s oldest and most iconic building,” Reingold said. “It is fitting that we are restoring it as a vibrant, student-centered hub and the new front door of the College of Liberal Arts. When this project is complete, campus tours will proudly walk through this reclaimed crown jewel of Purdue.”
The $26 million renovation project includes a complete restoration of the four-story, 34,200-square-foot building, with much-needed study and collaboration spaces, updated classrooms and welcoming student-services spaces.
“We are grateful for this opportunity to reimagine University Hall to reflect its historic elegance and its centrality as a gathering place for students,” said Lori Sparger, associate vice president for policy planning and chief operating officer for the College of Liberal Arts. “The restored University Hall will be a great point of pride for everyone who loves Purdue.”
The renovation of University Hall is the central component of a broader $46.6 million initiative encompassing renovations in Stanley Coulter and Beering halls. Updates include modern working and study environments, the creation of a 180-seat active learning classroom and a languages and culture hub, providing a new home for the Department of English.
The Purdue for Life Foundation is launching a $5 million fundraising campaign to support the University Hall renovation, which offers alumni, friends, and fans the opportunity to partner with John Purdue.
For more information on how you can be a part of the renovation project, contact David M. Williams, chief development officer for the College of Liberal Arts, at dmwilliams@purdueforlife.org or 765-427-0527.","[{'summary_text': 'the $26 million renovation project includes a complete restoration of the four-story, 34,200-square-foot building . it is part of a broader $46.6 million initiative encompassing renovations in Stanley Coulter and Beering halls .'}]"
"PhD student from China takes chance on America, finds ideal Purdue Polytechnic program and community","summarize:Like many young professionals in China, Fan Yang found herself in a strange situation in 2021. An economic crisis had swept through the country because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a time of economic contraction in her home country, it was nerve-racking to be in civil engineering.
So, Yang applied to universities abroad, looking to get an advanced degree in a new field but where her skills were still relevant. By chance, she discovered Purdue Polytechnic’s PhD program in technology, run by the School of Construction Management Technology.
Now, Yang is entering the second semester in the program, a level beyond what she’d ever thought possible. She’s working with her advisor Jiansong Zhang, assistant professor of construction management technology and a six-time National Science Foundation grantee, who has assisted Yang in adapting to the varied changes at Purdue.
“I’d never imagined myself going for a PhD until last year, basically,” Yang says.
While adjusting to various aspects of new field, Yang managed to complete her first project for Zhang: correcting a machine learning-trained robotic construction arm’s perception of 3D space. In June, she documented the process in a presentation at the 2023 I3CE Conference (International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering) at Oregon State University.
“After working with him (Professor Zhang), my research interests have finally started to settle on the topic of machine learning-trained robotics,” Yang says.
Between reading a completely new body of scholarly work for the first time, learning how to conduct a proper literature review on her research topics, and learning a new language, Yang says she’s “not at Purdue to sleep in late or just have fun on weekends.”
“To be honest I just have a sense that the research potential in this program is very promising,” Yang says. “It’s not really the conventional path for research, it’s an interesting blend of information technology applications combined with construction, infrastructure and site-level management.”

Polytechnic spotlight stories
At the same time, she was worried about being an unconventional learner. Not only is she an international student, Yang considers herself lacking “the normal academic background that so many people going for PhDs now have.”
“Just so you can understand where I’m coming from: I came into the construction management department without a background in how to write scientifically, let alone in English,” Yang says. “I even had to learn to do a literature review — so, for instance, every academic in training here had used Google Scholar; it’s an extremely common tool for most of them. And it was totally new to me!”
Before she could think about specific scholarly endeavors, Yang had to work closely with Zhang to completely shift her understanding of academic research. “There were moments where I was like, ‘I have so much catching up to do, why did Dr. Zhang agree to help me?’”
Professor Zhang clearly doesn’t feel the same way. “She’s an independent thinker and a fast learner. She has been highly motivated and determined in her studies,” he says.
Amid the flurry of activity of her first semester, Yang put a great deal of pressure on herself to progress in all the varied areas where she felt the need to catch up. “I used to get very stressed if I didn’t have immediate progress in my research, partly because I had all of these cultural and educational differences,” she says. “So, I had some pretty bad imposter syndrome for a while.”
Zhang has made an effort to assuage that thinking, too, in part by reminding Yang that she has already made a good deal of progress in a single semester and in spite of complex circumstances. “He’s given me invaluable advice,” Yang says.
Yang’s journey to Purdue actually started in the summer of 2021. Hoping to weather the economic storm and developing expertise in a more stable line of work, she applied to universities abroad to pursue a second master’s degree, taking extra care in selecting her field of study in computer science. She also started watching English-language TV to help improve her language skills in anticipation of leaving home.
Yang says she felt lucky to get an acceptance letter from a Canadian university in January 2022, as her real estate job fell out from under her shortly after. And a master’s degree in computer science, she thought, would be a more secure field with greater flexibility after her experience as a civil engineer during China’s economic downturn.
That is, until news started coming out that these industries in the U.S. also were facing significant instability. Yang felt déjà vu when she heard Google and Meta were in the midst of mass-firing employees in areas worryingly similar to her information systems degree.
By chance, she discovered Purdue Polytechnic’s PhD program in technology. And she was delighted to see that it listed both civil infrastructure and information technology as complementary disciplines — her precise academic background.
“This is a pretty new path for me, or even for some of my former classmates in situations similar to me,” Yang says. “I’m one of the only people from my alma maters back home to go study abroad in America or Europe, or anywhere like that.”
Moreover, Yang has been surprised to hear this level of understanding from her academic mentors. And she thinks Purdue Polytechnic’s School of Construction Management Technology possesses a long-term vision for success and excellence at the graduate level.
“They have everything you need here. Whether you’re looking to go into industry or advance the research community, there’s a support system for it,” she says.
And when it comes to the personal virtues cultivated at Purdue, Yang thinks the biggest one for her is self-confidence.
“I want to keep being brave, and to excel as much as possible. And I know there will be people to support me, so I don’t put so much stock in the momentary slow-downs or struggles anymore because I know they’ll pass,” Yang adds. “I remain confident that if I want to take the next step in my work, no matter where it leads me, I’ll get there soon enough.”","[{'summary_text': ""fan Yang is one of the only people from her alma mater back home to go to Purdue Polytechnic's PhD program in technology . she hopes to weather the economic downturn and develop expertise in a more stable line of work . her advisor has helped her adapt to the varied changes at the university .""}]"

Miller will also serve as a resource for Purdue West Lafayette faculty, as she will work closely with the West Lafayette campus and Indiana University in Indianapolis (IUI) to implement the General Education and STEM Education faculty consortium agreements to help coordinate faculty between West Lafayette and IUI for course delivery.
Miller brings strong curriculum and program development experiences built from collaborative partnerships, most recently serving as the associate chair and director of the undergraduate program for the IUPUI Department of Biomedical Engineering, where she helped develop, implement and assess curricular changes that embed engineering design, ethics and technical communication within the biomedical engineering curriculum.
Christine (Chris) Krull has been selected as the inaugural director of teaching and learning programs in the Division of Teaching and Learning at Purdue University in Indianapolis. She will be responsible for leading and coordinating efforts of the various functions of the Division of Teaching and Learning in support of Purdue University in Indianapolis students. Her developing team will span multiple functional areas in the Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning and work closely with functional leads to ensure success in these areas, collaborate with all Purdue University in Indianapolis partners and units, and serve as a member of the Teaching and Learning leadership team.
Krull has extensive experience at IUPUI, most recently serving as the College of Engineering Technology’s assistant dean for career and student success. She plans to retain her responsibilities as assistant dean and continue leading her current team during the transition period.
“Purdue University in Indianapolis strives to be a catalyst for growth and accelerate an innovation-based economy for Indianapolis, our state and our nation,” Umulis said. “We are making outstanding progress in integrating teams with experts who will support the future and mission of Purdue University in Indianapolis and are fortunate to have Sharon and Chris as top leaders.”
Miller is the co-founder of the Biomedical Engineering Education and Design Lab at IUPUI. Her externally funded engineering education work focuses on learning how undergraduate student self-efficacy relates to design achievement. Further, her efforts to increase experiential learning for undergraduates in Indianapolis have helped secure funding for a National Institutes of Health-supported summer clinical residency program for engineers in training that challenges students to integrate socioeconomic considerations into clinically relevant design. Miller’s effective coaching of design teams has led to local and national design student awards, and her creative leadership has forged opportunities for students to connect with several Indianapolis companies and resources.
Miller received a Bachelor of Science in materials science and engineering from Purdue University and a Master of Science and PhD in biomedical engineering from the University of Michigan.
Krull is a scholar of organizational leadership and a proven administrator and educator. She received a Bachelor of Business Administration in marketing from St. Joseph’s College and a Master of Education in adult and continuing education and teaching from Indiana University.

"National Depression Screening Day takes place Oct. 5 to raise awareness, promote resources","summarize:This year’s National Depression Screening Day takes place Oct. 5. The first National Depression Screening Day was held in 1991, and in 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force updated its recommendations on screening, which called for all adults to be screened for depression as part of primary care.
The day raises awareness about depression and promotes screening resources to individuals, who can then use them for assistance and treatment.
According to Mental Health America, as with other health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure or Type 2 diabetes, many individuals with depression are not aware of their illness. Via MHA, individuals can access 13 online screens 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The screens include depression (this screen is also offered in Spanish), bipolar, anxiety disorder, PTSD, ADHD, substance abuse, psychosis and more.
Take a mental health test today to get started.
Note: These online depression screenings serve as a quick and easy snapshot of an individual’s mental health and a way to spot some early signs of concern. Those whose online screenings prompt concern should speak with their primary care provider or a mental health professional for assistance and guidance.
Individuals who need someone to talk to about their mental health can utilize “warmlines.” A warmline, according to MHA, is a phone number individuals can call for a conversation with someone about their concerns. While warmlines are different from crisis lines, which are designed to help keep someone safe in the moment and connect them to resources as soon as possible, they also can help individuals in crisis get connected with appropriate help.

Any mission headed to space needs a “parking spot” at its destination. But these parking spots, regions located on orbits, are quickly becoming occupied or more vulnerable to collisions. Most objects launching to space are satellites, and about 10 times the number of satellites currently in space are expected to launch by 2030. “With this density of satellites, something is going to fail and cause a collision. It’s just a matter of probability,” said David Arnas, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics in Purdue University’s College of Engineering.

Abstract. Forests provide critical resources such as timber, fiber, and clean water and air, on which we are heavily dependent. Although digital technology continues to transform our daily lives, our forests are still managed using outdated technologies that are often imprecise and labor intensive. Here, I discuss how Purdue’s Institute for Digital Forestry is taking advantage of recent key developments in sensing technology and computational advancements to move this traditional field into the digital age. I highlight examples about how to merge cross-disciplinary knowledge to revolutionize the forestry sector, which has tremendous economic and ecological impacts. In particular, I showcase the use of different sensing technology from proximal, near-proximal, aerial and satellite-based sensing platforms and various AI models for automated measurement, monitoring and management of forest ecosystems.
Bio. Songlin Fei is a professor and the Dean’s Chair of Remote Sensing, and serves as the director of the Institute for Digital Forestry at Purdue University. Fei’s research includes forest ecology, invasion ecology and digital forestry. His research has significantly advanced the ecology and management of invasive species, the understanding of forest responses to climate change and the modernization of forestry into the digital age. His work has been published in over 140 peer-reviewed research articles, including those in Science, Science Advance, Nature Communications and PNAS. Fei currently serves as the PI for over $25 million of research funding.

Purdue professor foresees AI as catalyst for transformation in manufacturing and workforce,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
In the midst of rapid artificial intelligence expansion, Purdue engineering professor Karthik Ramani offers a positive perspective. He believes AI holds immense potential for bolstering manufacturing competitiveness, revolutionizing product design, democratizing programming and ushering in a workforce revolution.
Ramani, the Donald W. Feddersen Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering, who also holds appointments in electrical and computer engineering and the College of Education, shared these insights at a congressional briefing held at the Hart Senate Building in Washington, D.C., hosted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the U.S. Senate Artificial Intelligence Caucus.
Ramani envisions AI birthing entirely new industries and reshaping education across disciplines in ways yet unimagined.
“Unlike previous technologies, the impact of emerging AI on jobs differs, with upper-middle-skill positions, particularly in high-salary brackets like computer programming, being the most exposed,” Ramani said. He said those who align with AI will gain a competitive edge, “as job opportunities will emerge in fields yet to be conceived, creating new specializations in AI-driven development, integration and maintenance. The true extent of AI’s transformative power exceeds current imagination, offering new frontiers for human achievement.”
Drawing parallels to past technological revolutions, Ramani underscores AI’s potential to absorb labor and enhance productivity.
“At the beginning of every technological revolution, fears spread that technology will wipe out many jobs. In each past technological revolution, jobs were automated, but other jobs were created because the surplus wealth created by technology was spent on more labor-intensive industries,” Ramani said.
However, he acknowledges that bottlenecks in workflows remain a challenge for immediate widespread AI integration. Ramani asserts that the diffusion of AI outside computer sciences is as pivotal as the technology itself, necessitating a redesign of education, talent training and reimagining business processes around AI.
The panel discussion delved into the imperative for Congress and federal agencies to invest in AI tools for workforce development, emphasizing the essential institutional resources needed to advance U.S. competitiveness in AI-driven technology applications across educational fields and industries.
Ramani highlighted AI’s catalytic role in fostering diverse industries, from AI-powered health care and telemedicine to autonomous transportation, AR/VR experiences, precision agriculture, clean energy solutions, cybersecurity, personalized fashion, AI-driven finance, smart city management, educational technology, AI-powered content creation, machines and robotics control software, and genomics-driven personalized medicine.
“These burgeoning sectors are set to create new pathways for employment, signifying the profound impact of AI across various domains,” Ramani said.
Ramani envisions a future where humans specialize in tasks and industries that AI cannot replicate, such as caregiving for children and the elderly. He emphasizes that AI, while proficient, cannot replace the unique human connection.
He emphasized that Purdue’s role in empowering workforce productivity and talent through AI in manufacturing and design is crucial.
“Well-designed AI has the potential to upskill individuals on the job, reducing the need for extensive skilling programs. Seizing AI opportunities in the coming decade can substantially enhance human capabilities, potentially propelling the U.S. economy to greater heights.”

Purdue center addresses pressing challenge of securing semiconductor chips,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University’s emergence as a leader in semiconductor chips also requires it to usher in a new level of security that protects those essential chips needed for everything from your car and cellphone to artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The Center for Secure Microelectronics Ecosystem (CSME) at Purdue is tackling that challenge by developing the latest advances to protect today’s and tomorrow’s microelectronics and semiconductors. The center held its annual meeting Sept. 26-27 with university partners and industry sponsors, highlighting the research that connects the multi-institutional academic community with semiconductor industry leaders and the U.S. Department of Defense to safeguard economic and national security interests. The annual summit featured a number of industry representatives in attendance and over 30 student research presentations and posters.

Security in computer systems and electronics often revolves around software, but the underlying microelectronics have the same potential to be hacked. Purdue College of Engineering faculty and programs lead the effort for better security through research advances in microelectronics. CSME is addressing security challenges through grants funded by the center’s industrial and government partners for research projects across the nation.
“Initial chip design, fabrication and the final packaging into circuit boards is spread out across not only companies but also countries now,” said Joerg Appenzeller, CSME co-director and Purdue’s Barry M. and Patricia L. Epstein Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “This center ensures the semiconductor industry will be more resilient and prepared for security challenges, both large and small.”
CSME was announced in spring 2022 as a part of Purdue’s continued leadership in semiconductors. It is joined by university partners Arizona State, the University of Florida, Texas A&M and Georgia Tech. The center launched with support from founding companies TSMC and Synopsys in conjunction with support through a DOD-funded workforce development program.
TSMC announced an extension of its partnership with Purdue in June.
For CSME, the microelectronics supply chain represents as much potential for security issues as other considerations, which oftentimes means researchers are tackling problems akin to looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.
“Hardware security threats range from recycling older components as new, counterfeit parts to accidental or deliberate modifications to hardware that leaks sensitive information or causes malfunction in the field, to name a few,” said Anand Raghunathan, CSME co-director and the Silicon Valley Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “Our researchers are pursuing advances that will ensure a secure microelectronics ecosystem by eliminating traditional and emerging security attacks.”
Purdue is a national leader in microelectronics research, spanning the semiconductor ecosystem in software and hardware. CSME is one of six major centers serving as anchors for that work, with a number of ongoing research projects focusing on various aspects of design, packaging and reliability.
Semiconductor and workforce development work by CSME represents a pillar of the recently announced Purdue Computes. The initiative amplifies the university’s dominant position today in education, research and industry partnerships in semiconductors. Under Purdue Computes, $100 million of semiconductor facilities are planned, including upgrades to the Birck Nanotechnology Center.
CSME recognizes the need for new generations of skilled professionals to advance semiconductor security. As part of its workforce development efforts, the center works with graduate and undergraduate students, posing and answering scientific questions of relevance to a secure microelectronics supply chain.
That follows workforce development as a continued focus of the university through the first comprehensive Semiconductor Degrees Program and the Purdue-led SCALE (Scalable Asymmetric Lifecycle Engagement) microelectronics workforce development program.
CSME will provide research projects ripe for graduate students in SCALE, who will form the future workforce prepared to address the challenges of designing secure microelectronics.
Global connections to advance semiconductor research and workforce development have been a persistent pursuit at Purdue, which has established several international partnerships.
On May 21 Purdue President Mung Chiang signed a landmark international agreement during the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. Chiang signed another agreement in May for Purdue to become the flagship academic partner and collaborator with the government of India. In addition, Purdue, the state of Indiana and the Indiana Economic Development Corp. announced a partnership May 3 with imec, a Belgium-based semiconductor research and development firm.

$1.1 million grant to fund research on molecular response of plants to environmental stress,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The National Science Foundation has awarded a $1.1 million grant to Purdue University’s Gyeong Mee Yoon to research how plants acclimate to environmental stress. Her findings could have implications for food security in an era of climate change.
Yoon, an associate professor of botany and plant pathology, is probing two different biochemical pathways that plants use to improve their response to stresses such as drought, severe heat and cold. She examines the biosynthesis and signaling of the ethylene hormone, which is well-known for its role in regulating fruit ripening.
“Plant hormones are genuinely important for plant growth and development, but also very critical for how plants respond to stress,” she said. So is autophagy, another well-known process that describes how plants and animals begin to eat themselves to replace the loss of vital nutrients during stress conditions such as drought and nutrient deficiency.
Now, it appears there may be a link between the independent cellular signaling pathways of ethylene biosynthesis and autophagy.
“We believe that the signaling and metabolic pathways are interconnected. They influence each other by crosstalk, thus regulating the overall plant’s response to the environment,” Yoon said.
Yoon carries out her work using Arabidopsis, a well-understood and quick-growing plant. If plant scientists can learn the connection between the ethylene and autophagy pathways in Arabidopsis, she noted, they might be able to harness that knowledge to generate high-yield, pathogen-resistant, stress-tolerant plants.
An enzyme that goes by the acronym ACS plays a vital role in making ethylene. The ethylene biosynthetic pathway starts from amino acid methionine, and ACC, a direct precursor of ethylene, is formed before the process culminates in ethylene.
Scientists historically have used ACC as an easy substitute for ethylene in their experiments. ACC dissolves in water while treating ethylene, a gas, can be cumbersome. Recent works from other scientists indicate that ACC may function as an independent signaling molecule separate from ethylene. Interestingly, Yoon’s lab collected preliminary data supporting the independent signaling role of ACC in autophagy.
“Maybe ACC has its own job apart from ethylene when it comes to autophagy. This could help control the right amount of stress responses by managing communication between ethylene and autophagy,” Yoon said.
Her preliminary data also suggest that autophagy may serve as an alternative pathway for controlling ethylene biosynthesis. It may do so by regulating the stability of the ACS enzymes, the cellular process that regulates the amount of ethylene produced in plants.
In addition to research, the new NSF support also will sustain Yoon’s lab outreach to undergraduates, high school students and the public through various programs at Purdue.
Yoon has recruited undergraduates into her lab through the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship and the NSF-funded Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates.
She also offers hands-on laboratory research opportunities to high school students through Purdue’s Pre-College Molecular Agriculture Summer Institute. The institute provides Indiana high school students with one-week residential experiences on campus for mentored research in plant science. Since 2015 Yoon has recruited dozens of students through the institute from a broad range of schools to ensure the participants’ economic, ethnic and gender diversity.
Outreach also includes an annual seven-month internship for a local high school student to help research the role of plant hormones in stress responses. A student intern from Lafayette’s Jefferson High School who Yoon mentored in 2019-2020 received the Lafayette Regional Science Fair Gold Medal in Biochemistry, among other awards, for her ethylene-related research project.
The Yoon lab additionally sponsors a public outreach booth on “Hormones in Grocery Stores” at Purdue Spring Fest, hosted by the College of Agriculture. Graduate and undergraduate students staffing the booth lead exercises demonstrating how selective grouping of various fruits and vegetables can reduce ethylene-induced food spoilage.
“There are reasons why some fruit is separate from others in the grocery store,” Yoon said. “Many things regulated by plant hormones can affect our daily lives.”",[{'summary_text': 'the national science foundation has awarded a $1.1 million grant to Purdue University’s Gyeong Mee Yoon to research how plants acclimate to environmental stress . her findings could have implications for food security in an era of climate change .'}]
Fast Company names Purdue University a ‘Brand That Matters’ for third year in a row,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
For the third year in a row, Purdue University is the only university Fast Company magazine has placed on its roster of “Brands That Matter,” an annual list honoring organizations for performing their brand’s mission and ideals with intention and authenticity. Purdue shares this space with brands like the NFL, Bombas and Rare Beauty and is one of only six three-time honorees.
Fast Company received more than 1,100 applications for its 2023 list, ultimately selecting a roster of 165 brands for having “achieved relevance through cultural impact and social engagement.” This year, Purdue’s application showcased Purdue Innovates, the university’s in-house pipeline for technology commercialization, intellectual property protection and enterprise creation.

Purdue Innovates brings Purdue’s claims of solving real-world problems full circle by giving researchers the tools to move their work from the lab to the world, without learning the ins and outs of commercialization. This agile system takes advantage of a rich university ecosystem while ensuring that every innovative idea has a chance to make a difference in its field.
“I want to thank the Fast Company editors and judges who again selected Purdue University as a Brand That Matters, the only university on the list this year and every year since the inception of the honor,” says R. Ethan Braden, executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer for Purdue University and Purdue Global. “And I want to congratulate everyone at Purdue for contributing to a culture where the persistence to make a true difference together is at the center of what we do, every day.”
Fast Company says this year’s Education winners, a category Purdue shares with Sesame Workshop and Quizlet, deserve recognition for their “commitment to education.” The Fast Company selection cites Purdue Innovates as an initiative that “encourages students and faculty alike to explore and create,” making possible some of the university’s most world-changing research.
Over 800 patent applications have been filed and 262 patents have been issued for Purdue-born innovations so far during the 2023 fiscal year. In the same time frame, 14 startup companies have launched through Purdue Innovates, and the Trask Innovation Fund has granted seven awards to support short-term projects enhancing the value of ongoing Purdue projects.
During the 2022 calendar year, Purdue Research Foundation was ranked fourth among U.S. universities, ahead of Stanford and Harvard, for patents received from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
Purdue Innovates finds efficiency by making experts in patents, licensing, product marketing and business law available to researchers so they can focus on the science and education. Purdue’s experts have streamlined the process of applying for patents, licenses and starting companies, removing common barriers to commercialization for university-born projects.
In addition to proving excellence in technology transfer from lab to market, Purdue University remains one of the top producers of shared knowledge in the form of academic publication and education, demonstrated by its ongoing and renewed status as an R1 research institution and membership in the Association of American Universities.
“I’m very proud of this recognition. If anything at all, Purdue is driven to produce outcomes that matter,” said Brooke Beier, senior vice president of commercialization for Purdue Innovates. “This honor is a well-deserved nod to the passionate, entrepreneurial-minded faculty, staff, students, alumni and partners empowered by the Purdue ecosystem to bring world-changing technologies to market.”
Based at a public university, the Purdue Innovates team gets to focus on impact rather than profit.
For example, a malaria treatment developed by Purdue biochemist Philip Low may be produced at just $1 per pill, thanks to manufacturing partners in India and Vietnam. Results of a 2021 Phase 2 clinical trial showed the drug to be nearly 100% effective in defeating the disease in just three days. Meanwhile, Low continues other drug development projects, including FDA-approved prostate cancer diagnostics and lung cancer treatments.
In another case, materials engineer Rahim Rahimi has developed and is advancing a flexible microneedle array capable of delivering necessary oxygen and bactericidal agents into nonhealing wounds, which afflict more than 5 million people in the U.S. and are a leading cause of limb amputations. Last year, the innovation was an inaugural Proof of Concept Fund recipient, receiving over $89,000 to help bring to commercial use.
Other world-changing projects currently being assisted by Purdue Innovates include:
Smart contacts, which monitor for glaucoma better than current standards without the trip to a doctor and with the same comfort as a standard contact lens.
Food fraud prevention at the atomic level: detecting the ingredients, preparation and even point of origin of a food sample.
Polymer films used to make wearable biometric sensors that are flexible and breathable for extended periods of time.
HADAR: machine vision that sees texture and depth beyond traditional thermal imaging, essential for autonomous vehicles or robotics.
In addition to Fast Company’s “Brands That Matter” honor, Purdue has been recognized as a top 10 Most Innovative University for six straight years by U.S. News & World Report. As the country’s No. 4 most trusted public university, according to Morning Consult, Purdue has frozen tuition 12 years running, a move which will have saved Purdue families $1 billion by the end of this year. In July, Purdue was named No. 3 most recognized U.S. public university (and No. 10 globally), coming in ahead of institutions like Yale University, University of Cambridge and UCLA.

Purdue’s eXcellence in Manufacturing and Operations initiative focuses on resiliency in the industry,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University’s recently launched eXcellence in Manufacturing and Operations Purdue Engineering Initiative, or XMO PEI, is positioned to strengthen the U.S. advanced manufacturing industry’s adaptability for the 21st century across multiple sectors, such as semiconductors, aerospace, defense, biomanufacturing for agriculture, and transportation.
The XMO initiative is building a national coalition of academia, government and industry partners to meet at the intersection of physical, digital and sustainable manufacturing to achieve excellence at scale.
As part of the initiative, Purdue will in November host a summit at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) in Washington, D.C. This event will bring together industry, government and academic leaders to discuss building resilient U.S. infrastructure for advanced manufacturing and operations, which are critical to America’s security and economic durability in the era of globalization.
Summit announced: Building Resilient U.S. Infrastructure through Excellence in Manufacturing and Operations

“It’s not just advanced manufacturing in the sense of making things in a factory. It’s also the supporting operations that you need for creating these resilient supply chains, resilient infrastructure and a resilient workforce,” said Stephan Biller, the Harold T. Amrine Distinguished Professor in the School of Industrial Engineering and the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business.
Biller and Ajay Malshe, the R. Eugene and Susie E. Goodson Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering, were named XMO PEI co-chairs in May 2023.
Both are members of the prestigious National Academy of Engineering.
“Our biggest challenge is that the U.S. has great scientific innovations, technologies and minds. What we need is infrastructural resilience and a system for fast and real-world engineering and industrial translation of innovations at scale,” Malshe said. “While the U.S. is starting to make notable moves toward building a robust supply chain, we need to be more focused and intentional about resilient manufacturing and operations for the present and future as a matter of national security. We’re addressing that through the XMO initiative with a unified national message that ‘we make, and we move.’”
To bring about that change, the co-chairs said the country needs to undergo a seismic shift in the manufacturing sector.
Biller said the U.S. needs a manufacturing renaissance, adding, “At the same time we want to do it in a digitally enabled and sustainable way. The renaissance is quite critical for prosperity, for our ability to innovate and for our society. If you only design and then have other nations manufacture this, you’re losing your ability to innovate.”
Malshe, who is the inaugural director of the Manufacturing and Materials Research Laboratories, echoed Biller’s sentiments and added the shift supports a key pillar for economic stability and security.
“I would like to go from ‘designing in America and manufacturing elsewhere’ to ‘designing in America and manufacturing in America.’ That’s the renaissance I’d like to see, and that’s the renaissance we need to build resilience,” Malshe added.
The multidisciplinary scope of the co-chairs’ research mirrors the junction of disciplines that govern advanced manufacturing and operations today, as it spans physical processes, digital transformation and sustainable production. “The collaborative multidisciplinary approach at Purdue mirrors the endeavors of large and small innovators; most innovation happens in the intersection of disciplines today,” said Biller, who has 25 years of experience as a senior executive at companies including General Electric Co., General Motors Co. and IBM.
“I would argue that there is probably no resiliency without sustainability, because you really have to ensure that you produce in a more environmentally friendly way,” Biller said. “If you want the next-generation workforce interested in manufacturing, you better make sure that it’s happening sustainably.”
Malshe and Biller said the initiative will be an instrument to foster nationwide collaborations from multiple academic disciplines that share a common bond to develop, educate and retrain the workforce in critical industrial sectors.
Biller said accelerating the adoption of innovative technologies and tools in advanced manufacturing, strengthening operations, and bolstering the supply chain must benefit not only large corporations.
“We need to build an advanced manufacturing operations innovation ecosystem that will allow us to help the small and medium-sized businesses that supply the original equipment manufacturers,” Biller said. “If you want resilient supply chains and transparent supply chains, we need these small and medium manufacturers to transform in physical, digital and sustainable manufacturing.”
Biller cited work underway at Purdue’s Dauch Center for the Management of Manufacturing Enterprises, in which he serves as director, as the types of efforts to be supported by XMO PEI.
“In particular, it is contributing to Indiana’s electric vehicle product commission initiatives, analyzing transformational risk and opportunities in both innovation and workforce development and helping with courses and conferences to educate the small and midsize enterprises in digital transformation,” Biller said.
Malshe, who has more than 30 years of experience in industry and academia, said advanced manufacturing related to defense and in-space applications, agriculture and food security, transportation, and semiconductors is often not discussed.
“The new space age is upon us, and Space 2.0 will provide colossal returns for America’s engineering and scientific sectors,” said Malshe. “Today, space commerce, security and exploration are getting seamlessly interconnected to Earth physically, digitally and sustainably.”
Conexus Indiana, a statewide organization that exists to promote Indiana’s advanced manufacturing and logistics sector, hails Purdue’s critical role in the transformation of industry.
“Working with Purdue University, we look forward to accomplishing digital transformation and workforce readiness at scale,” Conexus Indiana president and CEO Fred Cartwright said. “Our efforts in digital transformation and workforce readiness, through statewide programs such as Manufacturing Readiness Grants and Catapult Indiana, contribute to building resiliency in these critical sectors.”
Along with national alliances, within Purdue the PEI will foster academic alliances across campus with the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, the College of Agriculture, the College of Science, and the Purdue Polytechnic Institute to statewide and national impact.

Space needs better ‘parking spots’ to stay usable — an engineer is finding them,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Any mission headed to space needs a “parking spot” at its destination. But these parking spots, regions located on orbits, are quickly becoming occupied or more vulnerable to collisions.
Most objects launching to space are satellites, which can travel faster than 4 miles per second in the regions where they park. About 10 times the number of satellites currently in space are expected to launch by 2030. Simultaneously, satellite constellations are increasing in number and size. These are groups of satellites working together as a system, such as for enabling GPS, observation of Earth, internet access and other types of communications.
“With this density of satellites, something is going to fail and cause a collision. It’s just a matter of probability,” said David Arnas, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics in Purdue University’s College of Engineering. “Satellite constellations are getting so big and numerous that it’s becoming impossible to accurately track them all and ensure their long-term safety even through computational means.”
Arnas and his graduate students are investigating how orbits could be used to design better parking spots for satellites both in areas closer to Earth, where many of these available locations have already been taken, and in other parts of space that will soon see an increase in satellite population, such as the large area between Earth and the moon called the cislunar region. His research group also is coming up with new methods for feasibly analyzing satellite constellations as they increase in size.
Arnas’ goal is to make space more equitable. Putting spacecraft in designated parking spots instead of just anywhere could reduce the likelihood of space becoming too cluttered for missions to safely take place.
“Space is a common resource of humanity, just like water and air. Even if it seems very vast, it is still limited. It is our responsibility to ensure that future generations will also have fair access to it,” he said.
No matter whether satellite constellations are located closer to Earth or eventually near the moon, space debris is an unavoidable issue.
Within just one month, pieces of debris from a satellite explosion or collision in low Earth orbit can cover the whole Earth. This debris could stick around for anywhere from a few years to several hundred years, depending on the altitude. If low Earth orbit becomes more crowded, satellites will have few places where they can quickly get out of the way of debris before getting hit.
This presents a mess of a math problem. But Arnas and his students are identifying how to organize large satellite constellations so that it’s feasible to predict how they should reconfigure when a massive debris cloud is headed their way.
“If we have a lot of satellites in an area where there’s been a fragmentation event, we will have to move these satellites. This means that we have to optimize not only the final positions of the satellites, but also the maneuvers that each satellite would have to perform in a very short period of time. And right now, that’s not possible to do if several large constellations are involved,” he said. “However, if you have a general structure, a distribution containing all satellites in the region, it’s not only possible, but something that we can do even with pen and paper. We can foresee the possibilities of reconfiguration and react very quickly if something unexpected happens.”
Arnas has made findings about how to estimate orbital capacity, reduce the risk of collisions within satellite constellations, and design satellite orbits that are more resilient to disturbances. One method he developed would help to calculate the minimum distance that satellites should maintain from each other so that no matter what happens in a particular orbit, each satellite would be far enough away to avoid a collision. He’s also proposed a new way to analyze large satellite constellations in subsets so that they are easier to study.
Currently, there are few policies regulating where satellites can be put in space. Through the tools he’s creating, Arnas hopes to help inform decision-makers on what the consequences could be for launching a new satellite or establishing a new constellation.
“I want to give policymakers a way to know how approving a mission is going to affect the future capacity and sustainability of the space sector,” he said.
The increase in space missions and satellite density doesn’t just affect spacecraft orbiting close to Earth.
Dozens of missions may be traveling through the cislunar region over the next few years, but it’s hard to chart the trajectories spacecraft should take for each individual mission. Solar radiation and the combined gravitational pull of the Earth, moon and other planets have a large effect on orbits and how they’re used.
To help solve this issue, Arnas’ research group is exploring how so-called resonant orbits could be used to design these trajectories and help spacecraft save fuel when traveling the 238,900 miles from Earth to the moon.
Arnas and Purdue graduate student Andrew Binder are building on an idea NASA explored in the past to propel satellites from low Earth orbit without expending fuel by using very long cable structures called “tethers.” Applying this idea to the cislunar region, Arnas and Binder envision building a reusable infrastructure in space based on a pair of tethers that could “catch and throw” satellites between Earth and the moon. One tether would be in orbit around Earth and the other would orbit the moon. The tethers would provide the necessary impulse for satellites to cross cislunar space so that they won’t have to use up fuel to perform that trip.
Although their findings are preliminary, Arnas and Binder are developing more complex models of this tether system that they hope could help lead to a more streamlined way to travel through cislunar space.
“If missions to the moon and back are going to become more common, then it could be very useful to have an infrastructure already built in orbit to transition payloads in the cislunar system,” Arnas said.

Midwestern Regional Climate Center develops Soil Temperature Climatology Tool,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Midwestern Regional Climate Center, which is housed at Purdue University, is launching a new tool in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Midwest Climate Hub to provide soil temperature threshold information based on historical data from the last 30 years.
Melissa Widhalm, the MRCC’s associate director and regional climatologist, said the Soil Temperature Climatology Tool will be crucial for the agricultural industry to better identify benchmark dates for when specific agronomic activities, such as planting and applying nutrients, should take place.
“Every spring and every fall we get numerous requests from farmers asking us at the MRCC when they should expect to be able to put seed in the ground or apply nitrogen, based on past soil temperatures,” Widhalm said. “While this isn’t a real-time monitoring program, this does clue in that piece of historical data that we didn’t have access to before so we can make better-informed decisions.”
Data for the tool was sourced from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), a model produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction that generates reanalyzed data for temperature, wind, moisture, soil and dozens of other parameters. Widhalm said using data from NARR was necessary because several areas across the Midwest lack substantial soil temperature measurements. These soil temperature estimates provide for an accurate historical perspective.
Laurie Nowatzke, coordinator of the USDA Midwest Climate Hub, expressed excitement over the tool’s release: “Soil temperature affects so many on-farm management decisions. We consistently hear from producers and agricultural service providers that they need better access to this key piece of climate information. As with many of MRCC’s data tools, the Soil Temperature Climatology Tool can help Midwestern farmers plan ahead during complex parts of the season.”
While the Soil Temperature Climatology Tool was developed with the farming community in mind, Widhalm said the data this tool provides will be useful for several other production areas.
“This will be helpful for anyone working with soil, whether that is construction companies needing to dig in the ground or a forester needing to haul cut trees across frozen ground,” she said. “We want people to understand this tool can be versatile for a multitude of industries.”
The Soil Temperature Climatology Tool is available to the public on the MRCC’s website.",[{'summary_text': 'the midwestern regional climate center is launching a new tool to provide soil temperature threshold information based on historical data from the last 30 years . the tool is available to the public on the MRCC’s website .'}]
‘Purdue Pursuits’: Toastmasters at Purdue,"summarize:For some, the thought of public speaking can be enough to trigger a flurry of nervousness, discomfort and anxiety. Zhenhua Zeng is no stranger to those emotions, but after spending eight years mastering the craft as a member of Toastmasters at Purdue, he embraces — even anticipates — new opportunities to grow as a presenter, communicator and leader.
Zeng, a research scientist in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering, joined Toastmasters at Purdue in 2015 — the year the club, created for Purdue faculty, staff and students, made its debut on the West Lafayette campus. As a non-native speaker with little experience preparing speeches, Zeng knew it could be the perfect opportunity to improve his English skills. But he was also fascinated by public speaking, and his top priority was to strengthen the communication and leadership skills necessary to excel in both oration and his profession.
“Learning how to be an effective communicator and leader is what’s most important to me,” says Zeng, who’s currently serving as the club’s 2023-24 president. “Leaders try to inspire others, and when I work with faculty, staff and students, I want to be engaging and motivating. Improving those skills is an endless process.”
Founded in 1924, Toastmasters International is a nonprofit organization with more than 270,000 members in over 14,200 clubs around the globe. Although each club has its unique culture, they all incorporate materials from Pathways, the organization’s flexible education program containing 11 specialized learning paths that help members build more than 300 skill set competencies.
New members of Toastmasters at Purdue often begin their journey along the presentation mastery path, which contains various speaking projects designed to teach the fundamentals of speech writing and delivery. After completing the path, they can pursue other areas to focus on skills like leadership, coaching, planning, persuasion, collaboration and more. Each path contains five levels, and individuals usually complete three speeches in each level to advance to the next.
Campus club members apply their presentation skills during weekly meetings built around three key elements: prepared speeches, impromptu speeches and speech evaluations. The formal meetings are designed to give everyone an opportunity to speak and receive constructive feedback — something Zeng has found to be especially helpful.
“I’ve received a lot of good feedback over the years,” Zeng says as he holds a folded slip of paper with a note reminding him to stand still when he speaks. “This one is very useful. I’ve collected them to remind me, and when I get them out, they’re still helpful.”
Before becoming president, Zeng served as the club’s secretary and vice president of education, two roles that allowed him to fine-tune his abilities as a leader in his field. Since then, he’s taken graduate, undergraduate and high school students under his wing to mentor and inspire them to become next-generation scientists and engineers.
Zeng’s communication skills have also transformed. Preparing and presenting speeches at national and global conferences have helped him discover new ways to organize his thoughts into cohesive, purposeful documents. Now, he’s a published researcher in top scientific journals like Science and Nature.
All of Zeng’s knowledge culminated two years ago when his alma mater, the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics within the Chinese Academy of Sciences, invited him to speak at the institution. He says Toastmasters at Purdue played a key part in opening that door.
“If you read my curriculum vitae, I regard myself as a world-class scientist,” Zeng says. “The reason I can do that is because of what I learned by transferring knowledge into action during my Toastmasters journey. Purdue is a world-class university, and we want the club to reflect that. We recruit world-class members, and we make world-class leaders.”
Whether you’re a faculty or staff member looking for ways to engage students in class; preparing to chair a meeting, symposium or committee; or seeking an outlet to strengthen your interpersonal skills, Zeng says there’s a seat at the table for you.
“At Toastmasters, you’re supposed to make mistakes; it’s practice,” Zeng says. “It’s OK because it’s a safe environment. You learn the skills, practice them and then apply them in the real world. It’s a link from knowledge to the real world.”
An open house event will be at noon Oct. 27 in Forney Hall, Room 3059 for faculty and staff interested in learning more about Toastmasters at Purdue.
Faculty, staff and students can also attend the club’s weekly meetings, which are noon to 1 p.m. on Fridays in Forney Hall, Room 3059. A virtual option is also available.
Members of the club pay a monthly membership fee of $10, which can be reimbursed.

Purdue-Ireland relationship fosters research and study abroad opportunities in pharmaceutical manufacturing,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University and leading academic and research universities in Ireland continue to build upon existing partnerships to bolster additional collaborative research efforts and study abroad opportunities.
Purdue was one of several U.S. universities invited to attend the American Irish Medical Summit in Dublin in August. Hosted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, AIMS is a collaboration of academic, government and industry leaders focused on the development and adoption of emerging health technologies, research and academic partnerships, and workforce leadership development.
“In its entirety, our trip represented a powerful trifecta of conversations between industry, academia and government,” said Alyssa Wilcox, senior vice president for partnerships and the Purdue president’s chief of staff. “We have been cultivating these relationships with our Irish partners for decades. This particular visit was pivotal as we create pathways toward innovative technologies and research efforts that are mutually beneficial.”

“There are significant parallels between both the state of Indiana and the country of Ireland in terms of scholarly research in the life sciences sector,” said Eric Barker, the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean of Pharmacy and a professor of medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacology. “Purdue is the perfect conduit for these partners to continue collaboration on innovative research, pharmaceutical discovery, and manufacturing and technology commercialization.”
Barker, who presented at the conference, said both Ireland and Indiana share a strong commitment to move discoveries that occur in research labs into the marketplace and improve patients’ lives. There is also a critical workforce development element to the relationship.
“Working together, learning from each other and developing collaborative relationships with faculty will help strengthen the Indiana pharma manufacturing sector and provide students and the industry with new training resources to support this fast-growing field,” Barker added.
In March, Purdue signed a five-year memorandum of understanding with the Ireland-based National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training, an international leader in biopharmaceutical manufacturing research and development and training. NIBRT partners with industry and academia to support international best practices in all aspects of biologics manufacturing training and research.
A key element of the agreement is to use the NIBRT business model to attract the best pharmaceutical experts to Indiana and train and retain them.
“There are continuing workforce needs around health care. It’s really a global problem, not just an Irish or American problem,” said former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who joined Purdue in October 2021 as executive director of Purdue’s Health Equity Initiatives.
Adams, who spoke at the conference, is also a Distinguished Professor of Practice in the departments of Pharmacy Practice and Public Health. Adams said through immersive international experiences, Purdue students can better understand global issues and prepare themselves for leadership roles.
“Through partnerships, such as with NIBRT, Purdue is playing a pivotal role to help produce the workforce of the future in advanced pharmaceutical development and manufacturing,” he said. “If we can send students to train cross-culturally, they’ll be better prepared for this new global workforce and global economy.”
Purdue and NIBRT already enjoy a close relationship. In June, Elizabeth Topp, professor in the Department of Industrial and Physical Pharmacy and the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering, was named the inaugural director of the William D. and Sherry L. Young Advanced Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals Institute.
She previously served as chief science officer for NIBRT. As part of Purdue’s ongoing partnership with NIBRT, Topp will continue to hold a joint research appointment with the institute.
Adams said while much of the focus was on biopharma, the summit allowed Purdue to showcase to international institutions other areas of excellence at the university that play a critical role in health.
“Our College of Pharmacy, our School of Nursing, our Department of Public Health, our veterinary school, our College of Agriculture — all of these different assets that we have at Purdue are helping us to be global leaders in the broader aspects of health,” Adams said. “There is now growing recognition that all of those fields play a vital role in health, beyond a hospital or traditional doctor.”
Barker said expanding the Purdue-Ireland relationship corresponds with the LEAP Innovation District in Lebanon, which is under development along Indiana’s Interstate 65 Hard Tech Corridor.
Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly and Company, which is a major player in Ireland’s pharmaceutical industry, has committed to build an R&D and manufacturing campus in the LEAP district.
“We continue to think about ways that we can contribute not only to new workforce talent development but also to retraining and upskilling of existing workforce to shift from traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing into more advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing — and finding opportunities to contribute to the training elements there as well,” Barker said. “Our partnership will help Purdue play a critical role in training the thousands of jobs coming to the industry.”

Pedestrian safety message,"summarize:Dear Purdue students, faculty and staff colleagues,Purdue Homecoming 2023 is here. And our normally bustling campus will be even busier this weekend, with thousands of Boilermaker alumni, family and friends joining our buzzing community of 60,000 students, faculty and staff for this wonderful annual tradition.
That means we all must place even greater vigilance on safety as we mix pedestrians, bicyclists, skateboards, and motorized and manual scooters with the additional visitors and fans for the full lineup of homecoming happenings across our beautiful campus.
Along with our outstanding Purdue public safety team, our Action Council on Student Housing and Wellbeing reminds our students, faculty, staff and visitors to put safety first at all times while navigating our busy streets, sidewalks and bicycle paths. One important reminder for bicyclists and scooter users: Please return these to their safe spots on or near campus. We ask everyone to play their part by simply paying attention to their surroundings.
In placing a renewed emphasis on pedestrian safety, our Action Council will partner with Purdue’s safety experts in Administrative Operations to soon launch a study to consider additional steps for enhanced public safety on campus. Our plan is to draw collective input from Purdue students, faculty and staff — including leaders in Purdue Student Government, Purdue Graduate Student Government, the University Senate, MaPSAC (Management and Professional Staff Advisory Committee) and CSSAC (Campus Support Staff Advisory Committee) — and the city of West Lafayette’s traffic safety officials.
Launched in January to provide an environment for success for all our students, faculty and staff, our Actional Council was created for such matters on our campus that require heightened attention — to be nimble and proactive in its mandate. Pedestrian safety is a key concern for the work of the Action Council, and a report on the study’s findings will be provided to the campus community upon its completion.
As we prepared for this semester, Administrative Operations partnered with the city of West Lafayette to reduce the speed limits for roads and streets on and around campus. Lower vehicle speeds lead to safer pedestrian movement, especially on a large college campus like Purdue.
Additional information about pedestrian safety is available on the Transportation Services website.
As Boilermaker family, friends and fans join us on campus this weekend to celebrate this special annual university tradition, we wish you all an enjoyable and safe homecoming.
Boiler Up! Hail Purdue. And Happy Homecoming 2023.

Reminder: Campuswide PurdueALERT test scheduled for today,"summarize:Purdue University will test its emergency notification system, PurdueALERT, at 10 a.m. today (Sept. 28). The test will include the activation of the outdoor all-hazards sirens.
The test will help the campus community know what the sirens sound like and what to do during a potential emergency. Jefferson Howells, director of Emergency Preparedness and Planning, says the university’s emergency plan should be easy for the campus community to understand and follow.
“It’s simple — if you are outside and hear a siren, go inside the nearest building,” Howells says. “If you are inside and hear a fire alarm, go outside.”
While the test requires no action, Howells says it should serve as a reminder to review Building Emergency Plans and the Emergency Procedures Guide.
The U.S. Department of Education requires at least one such test each year. Purdue typically tests the PurdueALERT system during fall and spring semesters.
As part of the test, other notifications also will be sent through text messages, Twitter/X (@purdueemergency), digital signs on campus, desktop popup alerts, Alertus beacons in classrooms, email and BoilerTV.
In the event of an actual emergency, the Campus Emergency Status webpage also will be updated. All incoming students and others who are new to campus are encouraged to sign up for emergency text message notifications.
The scheduled test is weather dependent. If needed, the test will be rescheduled for Friday (Sept. 29).
Additionally, the most recent versions of annual security reports for each campus are available on the Purdue University Police Department’s website. The Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is required by federal law and contains policy statements and crime statistics for Purdue. The policy statements address the university’s policies, procedures and programs regarding safety and security. To request a paper copy of a report, please contact the police department at 765-494-8221, at Terry House, 205 S. Martin Jischke Drive, West Lafayette, IN.
Emergency Preparedness and Planning is part of the Administrative Operations organization. The organization supports the university by providing safe, reliable and transformative services. Making sure the campus community is aware of the emergency notification system and knows how to respond in the event of an actual emergency is just one of the ways the organization helps power Purdue.

Purdue’s inaugural Lilly Scholars train to become pharmaceutical manufacturing workforce talent of the future,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University’s Lilly Scholars are hitting the ground running in their training to become the next generation of pharmaceutical manufacturing talent. Thanks to a $42.5 million collaboration between Purdue and Eli Lilly and Company, students earned pharmaceutical manufacturing scholarships and unique learning opportunities with one of the world’s most innovative pharmaceutical companies.
The dynamic new program, which was originally announced last October, annually offers 50-100 talented students full tuition with a guaranteed internship at Lilly and a promise of coordinated interaction with company leaders. Participating students will then be provided opportunities to compete for a role at the company following graduation.
“The incredibly innovative Lilly Scholars at Purdue program is one that will have a profound impact on the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry,” said Kimberly Graham, Pharma co-op and Lilly Scholars program manager. “The partnership between Purdue University and Eli Lilly and Company is one that prioritizes building a diverse pipeline of talent right here in Indiana, developing interest in pharmaceutical manufacturing, and inspiring academic and industry excellence.”
Lilly Scholars at Purdue program
Lilly commits $92.5 million to Purdue to establish an innovative pharmaceutical manufacturing scholarship program and to extend research collaboration
Gift to Purdue University establishes Institute for Advanced Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals
Just two months into their college careers at Purdue, the inaugural Lilly Scholars are already engaging with industry professionals, developing friendships with colleagues, planning for their guaranteed internships at Lilly, and participating in exciting experiential learning opportunities that span both the curricular and social spaces.
“The Lilly Scholars program provides me with endless networking and professional development opportunities that I couldn’t receive otherwise,” said Maria Molina, a data science major. “I was originally unsure of my college destination, but after being accepted, my college decision seemed like a no-brainer, and being a Lilly Scholar is the reason I became a Boilermaker.”
Pharmaceutical companies like Lilly have recognized the need for heavy investments in economical methods of manufacturing drugs, instead of just drug discovery, and leveraged the unique position of Purdue and the state of Indiana to strengthen pharmaceutical manufacturing in the Midwest. Over the last five years, Lilly has committed over $6 billion in pharmaceutical manufacturing globally.
Purdue has strengthened its commitment to pharmaceutical manufacturing as well, launching the William D. and Sherry L. Young Advanced Manufacturing of Pharmaceuticals Institute last year, thanks to a generous donation from pharmaceutical and biotechnology pioneer William D. Young. The institute offers opportunities for workforce development, with the potential to train future Indiana workers in the basics of the pharmaceutical industry, and serves as a workforce training resource for Midwestern pharmaceutical companies. In fall 2023, the Young Institute in collaboration with Purdue’s Office of Professional Practice has launched a new undergraduate certificate in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The unique experiential learning certificate provides core curriculum for pharmaceutical careers and is open to students from various majors like the Lilly Scholars cohort.
Professor Elizabeth Topp, director of the Young Institute, gave a kickoff lecture to the Lilly Scholars in one of their fall classes. “It was great to meet such an engaged group of students, so keen to learn about the pharmaceutical industry,” Topp said. “It’s exciting to imagine how they’ll transform the industry in the years to come, following in the footsteps of amazing Purdue alumni like Bill Young.”
The Lilly Scholars program encourages applicants who are from under-resourced urban and rural populations, who have overcome socioeconomic or educational disadvantages, or who are among the first generation in their family to attend college, and applicants with a commitment to reducing barriers to education. Students applying to majors that relate to the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry can apply for these awards.
Incoming Purdue undergraduates wishing to apply for the 2024 Lilly Scholars program will have to do so by Nov. 1.

Purdue researchers develop a new type of intelligent architected materials for industry applications,"summarize:Purdue University civil engineering researchers have developed patent-pending intelligent architected materials that can dissipate energy caused by bending, compression, torque and tensile stresses, avoiding permanent plastic deformation or damage, and may also exhibit shape memory properties that allow them to have actuation capacity.
Avoiding damage makes the material reusable and improves human safety and structure durability in products across several industrial sectors.
Pablo Zavattieri, the Jerry M. and Lynda T. Engelhardt Professor in Civil Engineering, leads the research team that has developed this new class of intelligent architected materials.
“These materials are designed for fully recoverable, energy-dissipating structures, akin to what is referred to as architected shape memory materials, or phase transforming cellular materials, known as PXCM,” Zavattieri said. “They can also exhibit intelligent responses to external forces, changes in temperature and other external stimuli.”
Intelligent architected materials such as these have a wide range of potential applications due to their unique properties.
“These materials can change from one stable configuration to another, making them versatile and valuable for various applications including earthquake engineering, impact-resistant structures, biomedical devices, sporting goods, building structures and automotive components,” Zavattieri said.
Virtually any material, including polymers, rubber, concrete and more, can be utilized to make the Purdue intelligent architected materials as long as they are designed to remain in the elastic regime.
“While it’s true that more brittle materials present greater design challenges, consider this: One of my PhD students successfully crafted a single-unit cell using concrete, a material known for its brittleness in tension,” Zavattieri said. “Creating these intelligent materials is all about effective design, making material choices remarkably versatile.”
Zavattieri and his team also have proven the materials’ scalability.
“We have produced intelligent architected materials as large as 12 inches, which are ideal for applications like building and bridge construction to absorb and harness energy,” Zavattieri said. “Conversely, we have created materials with unit cells smaller than the thickness of a human hair. This scalability opens up a world of possibilities from macro to micro applications.”
Cellular or foam materials are characterized by a porous microstructure or interconnected beams, columns or trusslike structures, with both solid spaces and empty spaces that form a lattice or honeycomb arrangement. Examples found in nature include bone, cork, foam, honeycombs, sponge and wood.
“Manufacturers have applied the concept of cellular structures to create lightweight lattice structures in the aerospace industry, to enhance crash energy absorption in the automotive industry and to design protective packaging for delicate items in the transportation industry,” Zavattieri said.
He said most of these materials have a single stable configuration.
“Changes in the cellular geometry as a result of an applied load typically will be limited either by the desire to prevent permanent deformation or the fact that it is impossible to return to the original stable configuration,” Zavattieri said. “There is an unmet need for a material structure that has a more stable configuration.”
Zavattieri said the new intelligent architected materials developed at Purdue redefine the concept of cellular materials.
“We have engineered the topology of their inner building blocks, which are made of beams, columns, trusses and other elements,” he said. “They are able to bend, twist, buckle and deform in highly controlled and programmable ways. These precisely tailored deformations give rise to emergent properties such as enhanced energy absorption, increased work capacity, morphing capabilities and adaptability. These properties open up innovative possibilities for various applications.”
Zavattieri and his colleagues have applied the compliant nature of cylindrical shells to create the materials.
“Energy is dissipated via snap-through mechanisms, allowing for avoidance of plastic deformation,” he said. “Simulations were utilized to identify the relations between unit cell design parameters and deformation modes, and this knowledge was carried over to manufacture prototype specimens for validation. It was shown that energy dissipation and peak load capabilities could be optimized by changing ligament lengths and angles of inclination.”
Zavattieri’s research has been published in the peer-reviewed journals Engineering Structures, Extreme Mechanics Letters, Scientific Reports, Journal of Applied Mechanics, Matter, International Journal of Solids and Structures and Engineering Structures. His research has received funding from General Motors, ITAMCO (Indiana Technology and Manufacturing Companies), the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Air Force.
A collaboration between Zavattieri and ITAMCO has used metal 3D printing materials to develop new aircraft runway mats for temporary or expeditionary flight operations.
The lightweight 3D printed panels consist of a carbon-fiber reinforced metal composite, allowing them to have high stiffness while remaining lightweight. This panel system is an alternative to conventional AM-2 panels and offers improved longevity and mechanical properties. Applications of this technology include rapid deployment of structures or runways for defense, public health and natural disaster response.
Zavattieri and his team validated the lightweight 3D printed panels through field tests.
“The objective of the research is to develop a robust sheet or roll technology that serves as an alternative to the AM-2 mat,” Zavattieri said. “AM-2 matting has served the U.S. military well since the Vietnam War, but the materials and technology in the ITAMCO-led research project will offer many benefits over AM-2 matting.”
Zavattieri said a portable and lightweight airfield mat must be easy to install and store yet capable of withstanding the stresses of repeated aircraft takeoffs and landings.
“Products made with PXCM geometry have the ability to change from one stable configuration to another stable or metastable configuration and back again,” Zavattieri said. “This means the new runway mat could potentially heal itself, resulting in a much longer life span than a runway made with AM-2 matting. Another benefit is that debris on the runway will not hamper the runway’s performance with our technology.
“In testing, these mats were capable of withstanding over 5,000 landing and takeoff cycles over a 60-day period while showing no signs of failure. Current conventional runway mats fail at approximately 1,500 cycles. This durability means fewer replacements of the mats, which require fewer financial resources.”
Zavattieri said the U.S. Army has identified a critical need for the development and deployment of nonpneumatic tires, or tires that are not supported by air pressure. As a result, nonpneumatic tires are not prone to punctures or leaks.
Zavattieri and his research team have developed a computer-based model supporting the use of the Purdue phase transforming cellular materials in the design of a nonpneumatic tire as specified by the Tire and Rim Association standards. He said the results demonstrate feasibility, through modeling and simulation, of PXCM as a dynamic, elastically deformable solution for the design of nonpneumatic tires (NPTs).
“This effort has shown that PXCMs can provide good performance on paved surfaces and provide good adaptability to the off-road environment,” Zavattieri said. “For military vehicles of interest, tires are designed to mitigate different-sized obstacles, loading conditions and variable terrain typically encountered in theater like sand, mud, gravel and snow. Modeling and simulation of designs demonstrate a PXCM-based nonpneumatic tire is capable of meeting performance requirements for both on-highway and off-road applications over varying load conditions and can resist loss of mobility due to material loss, up to 20%, resulting from ballistic/explosive threats or road debris. Model results suggest PXCM-based NPTs have the potential to extend vehicle capability and increase the probability of mission completion despite having sustained damage.”
Zavattieri disclosed the phase transforming cellular materials and their applications to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for patents to protect the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in commercializing the materials for the marketplace should contact Dipak Narula, assistant director of business development and licensing in physical sciences, at dnarula@prf.org about 2018-ZAVA-68252, 2019-ZAVA-68691, 2020-ZAVA-69072 and 2022-ZAVA-69900.

Understanding the gravity of the situation: ALPHA scientists prove that antimatter falls at the same rate as matter,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Early on in science classes all over the world, students drop diverse things to learn how gravity works and how outside forces might affect the rate of fall. But the science of falling goes well beyond the bowling ball and feather experiment. Einstein’s theory of relativity is still being studied, applied and proven in a multitude of ways today. For instance, the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus (ALPHA) project, based at CERN, published in Nature on Wednesday (Sept. 27) about the science of antimatter with the goal of discovering if gravity affects matter and antimatter in the same way. Spoiler alert: It does!
Scientists with the ALPHA program, including Purdue University professor Francis Robicheaux, work with trapped antihydrogen atoms that they create and, by precise comparisons of hydrogen and antihydrogen, use to study the fundamental symmetries between matter and antimatter. They have, for the first time, determined that antimatter falls at the same rate as matter and ruled out the theory of repulsive antigravity. In this experiment, experimental and theoretical physicists learn how gravity affects the motion of antimatter.

"LeafSpec LLC, a Purdue-connected ag-tech startup, to compete for $3 million in prizes in November","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
An ag-tech startup launched by a Purdue University researcher-entrepreneur to strengthen worldwide food security could soon win a million dollars and garner international recognition.
LeafSpec LLC has been named one of 20 international startups to compete for $3 million in total prize money during the Grow-NY Food and Ag Summit in mid-November. The company has an exclusive license to manufacture and sell patent-pending, Purdue-developed, handheld plant phenotyping technology. Plant phenotyping is the process of measuring and studying the physical characteristics of plants, including their growth, development and response to environmental factors.
Jian Jin, LeafSpec’s president and CEO, developed the technology. He also is an associate professor in Purdue University’s Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering.
“LeafSpec is an accurate, affordable and portable hyperspectral crop leaf scanner,” Jin said. “Our handheld device and software can provide accurate and early detection of plant diseases, nutrient deficiencies and stresses from chemical sprays. This is done within seconds without damage to the plant.
“It then relays the measurement results to a farmer’s or scientist’s smartphone. This information can guide users to make quicker and smarter decisions on fertilizing, spraying and irrigation, saving their cost and improving the yield. The result is improved food security: additional crop resiliency and production that leads to more crops available for harvest and worldwide consumption.”
The Grow-NY Food and Ag Summit is an annual competition that identifies, supports and funds global agriculture, food and beverage innovations. Awards include a $1 million grand prize, two $500,000 prizes and four $250,000 prizes.
Jin said there are additional benefits to LeafSpec being a Grow-NY finalist.
“Winning the prize money would impact our business, of course, but we will also receive dedicated mentorship from a business advisor and networking introductions and tours with potential partners during Grow-NY,” Jin said. “It also will be informative to connect with the other finalists: agriculture, food and beverage entrepreneurs from across the United States, Canada, India and the United Kingdom.”
Jin disclosed the imaging software and hardware innovations to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has submitted patent applications on the intellectual property and has already been granted one issued patent. OTC licensed to LeafSpec the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell the technology.
“There have been many large-scale plant phenotyping facilities and systems developed and used by big ag companies and academic institutions within the last 15 years,” Jin said. “But we successfully miniaturized the technology at the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Purdue. With our exclusive license to the Purdue technology, LeafSpec is now delivering the most advanced phenotyping technology with an easy-to-use handheld device. It’s gratifying to have built a tool that can impact the lives of growers and scientists around the world.”
Most of LeafSpec’s current customers are plant scientists and breeders from universities and large companies.
“Our customers’ research and field scouting efforts have greatly benefited from LeafSpec’s distinctive spatial-spectral resolutions and enhanced signal clarity. This enables them to gather unprecedented quality of hyperspectral leaf images for stress analysis, leading to the discovery of novel plant stress signals and enhanced measurement accuracy,” Jin said.
“The ag engineers at Purdue have published exciting new findings on nitrogen stress signals using LeafSpec. Similarly, numerous researchers investigating different diseases, nutrient deficiencies and chemical damages can do the same.”
LeafSpec sells multiple models of its device to cover different species such as corn, soybeans, wheat, rice and grapes. Its license also includes AI models for plant traits such as nitrogen content and robotic technologies to operate LeafSpec in the field fully automatically. Demonstrations of these plant phenotyping robots, such as PhenoBee, can be found at Jin’s research website.
LeafSpec sold its first device in 2019. In summer 2023, the company registered sales of nearly $400,000.
“We can only fulfill a very limited portion of the incoming requests,” Jin said. “We are working to further strengthen our manufacturing capability and expand the technical support team in order to scale up the business.
“While there is a great potential to expand the business within the research community, we’re planning to introduce field scouting services to farmers. Field research over the past four years has demonstrated that LeafSpec can deliver significantly improved accuracy in measuring corn nitrogen content. This aids farmers in making informed fertilization decisions, addressing a market worth over $10 billion in the U.S. LeafSpec and Purdue are currently collaborating with major ag industry companies and fellow land-grant universities to test the technology for this market.”

Purdue University jumps to No. 33 nationally and to world’s top 100 in 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University is among the world’s best academic institutions, according to yet another highly regarded ranking. The 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, released Wednesday (Sept. 27), ranked Purdue the No. 33 university in the U.S. and No. 86 worldwide, up from No. 40 and No. 127 in the last round and reflecting Purdue’s rising global reputation.
Among U.S. public universities, Purdue ranked No. 14, and among public land-grant universities, Purdue ranked No. 9.
Across all universities worldwide, Purdue is the only university from Indiana among the top 100.
“What we do each day is not about any ranking, but instead rankings partially reflect what we do relative to higher education peers in the state and the country,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “Purdue will continue to be distinct, humble and competitive in our small steps and giant leaps. One brick higher in excellence at scale.”
The World University Rankings are produced annually by Times Higher Education and have been compiled since 2004. This 20th edition marks the first substantial methodological update since 2011, adding new measures focused on the quality of research and patents. The rankings are based on 18 calibrated indicators that measure an institution’s performance.
“As we aspire to be a top public land-grant university, rankings such as these reflect our strong and continued progress,” said Patrick J. Wolfe, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity. “Our continued rise is due entirely to the consequential work our faculty, students and graduates produce each day.”
Purdue scored a top 10 placement among U.S. public universities and advanced five spots to No. 27 among all U.S. universities in the QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) World University rankings in June, which included both undergraduate and graduate/research components and placed Purdue again as a top 100 university in the world as well.
The Times Higher Education rankings come just a few weeks after Purdue’s best-ever showing in U.S. News & World Report’s 2024 Best College rankings of undergraduate programs. Purdue jumped eight spots to No. 43 overall, and moved to No. 17 among public universities, on a list of 435 ranked national universities. The university also scored a sixth consecutive top 10 Most Innovative (No. 7) ranking. Thirteen undergraduate programs were individually ranked in the top 10 nationally, with agricultural and biological engineering (No. 1 in U.S.), industrial engineering (No. 2), and aeronautics and astronautics (No. 3, historic high) earning top 3 placements.
THE’s latest rankings are consistent with a bevy of other accolades Purdue has collected in recent months, which reflect a range of ranking emphases and methodologies:
This past July, Purdue was ranked the No. 3 most recognized public university in the U.S. and No. 10 worldwide in the Global University Visibility rankings.
Purdue was also named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies — coming in at No. 16 overall and No. 1 in education — and the only university among Fast Company magazine’s Top 50 Most Innovative Companies.
Earlier this month, SmartAsset recognized the university’s excellence at scale by ranking Purdue the No. 6 Best Value among public universities in the U.S. and No. 15 overall.

Purdue turf professor weighs differences between natural and artificial turf,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
As a debate arises in the NFL and other professional sports over the benefits of choosing natural or artificial turf for athletic fields, Cale Bigelow, professor of horticulture and landscape architecture in Purdue University’s College of Agriculture, suggests that both turf types have positives and negatives to consider.
Bigelow, who specializes in turfgrass science and management, explains that injury rates for athletes depend on multiple factors, making it difficult to position one turf type as better than the other.
“What we know about natural grass fields is that they’re really good and actually preferred by a lot of athletes, but they are also limited by how much they can grow and recover,” Bigelow said. “But what I can also tell you is a frozen natural grass field is not as safe for athletes as a nonfrozen synthetic field.”
Bigelow is available for interviews on this topic by Zoom and in person on Purdue’s campus.","[{'summary_text': ""professor of horticulture and landscape architecture in Purdue University's college of agriculture suggests both turf types have positives and negatives to consider . injury rates for athletes depend on multiple factors, making it difficult to position one turf type as better than the other .""}]"

New Military Advisory Board to boost Purdue’s Online Learning 2.0 initiative,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A new Purdue Online Learning 2.0 Military Advisory Board will help identify avenues to advance Purdue’s overarching objective of educating and supporting more military-affiliated students, especially through the unmatched continuum of online educational programs Purdue offers.
Purdue President Mung Chiang said the aim is to better understand the educational needs of military veterans and uniformed personnel and to remain a trusted partner in meeting those needs with high-quality, innovative online programs delivered at scale.
Chiang’s Online Learning 2.0 initiative consists of two coordinated efforts: Purdue Global as a virtual campus for working adults with an emphasis on bachelor’s degree completion and workforce training and Purdue University Online as the online extension of the West Lafayette campus with an emphasis on graduate-level degrees and certifications serving working professionals.
Purdue has a goal of doubling military-affiliated online learners by 2026. Purdue Global serves approximately 10,000 military-affiliated students, including uniformed personnel, veterans and eligible dependents. Purdue University Online serves hundreds of military-affiliated students.
The new advisory board includes an impressive and diverse group of retired senior military leaders, some of them with Purdue ties. The board members include Navy Fleet Master Chief April Beldo, Navy Vice Adm. Kendall Card, Air Force Maj. Gen. Theresa Carter, Army Lt. Gen. Karen Gibson, Coast Guard Adm. Charles Ray, Navy Vice Adm. Scott Van Buskirk, Air Force Lt. Gen. Chris Weggeman and Navy Senior Executive Service Steffanie Easter. Ray, Weggeman, Gibson and Carter are Purdue alumni, and Carter is a member of the Purdue Board of Trustees. Gibson currently serves as sergeant at arms of the U.S. Senate.
“It was an honor to host distinguished individuals across all military branches who comprise Purdue’s first-ever online education military advisory board,” Purdue Global Chancellor Frank Dooley said. “Having access to their insights allows us to hone our approach to educating our service members in an effective way.”
Dimitrios Peroulis, senior vice president for Purdue University Online, said Purdue is uniquely positioned to impact the world through online education, extending its traditional land-grant mission.
“We take online education seriously at Purdue,” Peroulis said. “The military advisory board’s input can assist us in making it work optimally for veterans and uniformed service members.”
At their initial meeting, advisory board members suggested focusing on Purdue’s reputation for quality and rigor in strong programs Purdue already has, spanning fields such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, hypersonics, semiconductors and unmanned vehicles. Educational programs in those areas promise to benefit the services as well as service members — during their military careers and post-career — and they have the potential for leveraging world-class Purdue faculty members who conduct cutting-edge defense, homeland security and military research.
Articulating credit for military service and training must remain an important focus, advisory board members said. Dooley noted that credit-granting for life and work experience is integral to, and a major feature of, Purdue Global. Meanwhile, Purdue University Online may have fashioned a model recently in its new educational partnership with the Navy Test Pilot School, which stacks the intensive Navy training students at the school undergo with Purdue online courses to build graduate degree programs in engineering and technology.
Anytime, anywhere flexibility already is a strong point for Purdue’s online programs among military-affiliated as well as nonmilitary students. But active-duty military learners may come with some unusual needs that require additional accommodation. Peroulis pointed to a Navy submariner in an online course he is teaching who will be under water, literally, and out of touch for weeks at a time while deployed. The two had to figure out a way for the student to continue the course with no ability to connect online.

Purdue professor directs lab for global legume systems research program,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A program led by Michigan State University’s (MSU) College of Agriculture and Natural Resources in collaboration with the Purdue University College of Agriculture has received a five-year funding extension from the U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID), bringing the total project’s support up to $35 million.
The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Legume Systems Research focuses on cowpea and the common bean. The lab, which currently works in West and Southern Africa, will expand into the African Great Lakes region, East Africa, Central America and the Caribbean.
“Collaboration between land-grant institutions to aid developing countries in their growth is always a win-win,” said Doug Buhler, associate vice president for research and innovation at MSU. “Our collective experiences enhance our international development efforts. We are pleased to have Purdue as a part of the Legume Systems Innovation Lab team.”
Barry Pittendrigh, the John V. Osmun Endowed Chair in Urban Entomology at Purdue and adjunct professor at MSU, leads the lab as its director. “This is a natural fit,” Pittendrigh said. “Purdue and MSU are both leaders in global agricultural research and development.” His Purdue colleague John Medendorp, associate director of the Center for Urban and Industrial Pest Management, is the Legume Systems Innovation Lab assistant director.
“This support from USAID underscores Purdue’s ongoing commitment to conducting impactful agricultural research,” said Gerald Shively, associate dean and director of International Programs in Agriculture at Purdue.“ Dr. Pittendrigh and his team have established a strong working relationship with colleagues at Michigan State University, and this project brings together the best that agricultural science has to offer to improve food and nutrition security for smallholder farmers worldwide.”
Legumes are a nutrient-dense staple crop that have multifunctional roles in smallholder farm systems in developing countries. These include food and nutrition security, generating income, providing livestock feed and fodder, contributing to the sustainability of soil systems through their nitrogen-fixing capabilities, and helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change as low greenhouse gas-emitting crops.
“During this new phase, we will be looking toward improving the legume system efficiencies, which will have a profound impact on the availability of nutritious foods for malnourished populations,” Medendorp said.
Over the next five years, the Legume Systems Innovation Lab will pursue four key focus crop objectives: best agronomic practices and services, inclusive inputs and market systems, targeted varietal scaling and development, and climate change adaptation and mitigation.
Anticipated key results of the extended work include inclusive and sustainable agriculture-led economic growth; strengthened resilience among people and systems; and a well-nourished population, especially among women and children.
Cross-cutting intermediate result goals and objectives for the Legume Systems Innovation Lab also include improved climate risk and other natural resource management; gender equality and female empowerment; increased youth empowerment and livelihoods; more effective governance, policy and institutions; and improved human, organizational and system performance.
The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Legume Systems Research is funded through Feed the Future, the U.S. government’s global hunger and food security initiative led by USAID. The Legume Systems Innovation Lab was awarded to Michigan State University in 2018. This extension will continue its work through August 2028.","[{'summary_text': 'the feed the future innovation lab for legume systems research focuses on cowpea and the common bean . the lab will expand into the African Great Lakes region, East Africa, Central America and the Caribbean . key results of the extended work include inclusive and sustainable agriculture-led economic growth .'}]"

Exploring AI together across Purdue,"summarize:Dear students, faculty and staff colleagues,
As AI tools, such as large language models and generative algorithms, impact our world like never before, we at Purdue are actively and critically studying this quickly evolving landscape, and its potential opportunities and implications, along five dimensions.
Purdue offers a wide array of opportunities for faculty, researchers and students to join the conversation on AI, including the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) and the Governance and Responsible AI Lab (GRAIL). Thank you in particular to all who joined for stimulating presentations and conversations at last week’s 2023 Purdue System-Wide Virtual Forum on Reimagining Higher Education with Artificial Intelligence.
Together with our Purdue Student Government and University Senate, consultative processes are well underway this semester with students and educators across Purdue to evaluate and clarify the use of AI in teaching and learning. These tools and applications have the potential to offer new learning opportunities, as well as the potential to disrupt how we learn, in ways we cannot yet fully foresee.
In the meantime, we encourage faculty — both individually and collectively within each department — to carefully and thoughtfully evaluate the effects of generative AI tools in your courses. Potential areas of emphasis include impacts on the process of student learning, the ability to evaluate learning outcomes effectively, academic integrity assurances, and issues related to the use of others’ intellectual property. The Purdue Innovation Hub, the Innovative Learning Team and the Teaching and Learning Community of Practice are good resources as you continue to think strategically about policies and implications.
Simultaneously, teams across the university have been exploring the innovative and responsible uses of AI to enhance various university processes — one example being automated systems for travel expense reimbursements — in our ongoing efforts to enhance faculty productivity.
We encourage the innovation and ingenuity of each of you interested in developing AI tools for studying and learning, and we look forward to working with you and supporting you in that process. Especially for our student inventors and entrepreneurs who have developed some of the first home-grown AI tools within higher education institutions, along with Purdue Innovates, we will provide guidance in the weeks to come so that you can engage in ways that are most helpful to your academic progress and compliant with the rapidly evolving legal and policy landscape.
There are many programs at Purdue for students to develop their expertise in AI, including the Department of Computer Science’s BS in Artificial Intelligence, the Department of Philosophy’s BA in Artificial Intelligence, and Electrical and Computer Engineering’s minor and concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, as well as a range of courses throughout the university that explore the intersection of AI and other disciplines.
Purdue is set to lead the way in physical AI, where bytes meet atoms to help Indiana be world-leading in key areas such as digital agriculture, advanced manufacturing, precision health and transportation logistics. Under the auspices of our new universitywide Institute for Physical Artificial Intelligence (IPAI) and in partnership with our executive vice president for research, we are engaging faculty across Purdue, seeding new AI research collaborations and partnerships that build on our current strengths, and helping to build out new areas of physical AI strength by bringing new faculty talent to Purdue. Whether you are an undergraduate student interested in summer opportunities, a new PhD student seeking an emerging research area, or a faculty member looking to partner with colleagues across disciplines, we are excited to facilitate connections for you across our campus and create new opportunities to further your scholarly impact.
I look forward to hearing from you as together we explore all that AI has to offer across Purdue.

"Purdue’s semiconductor innovation ecosystem grows with CHIPS-funded, Indiana-led semiconductor hub and with upcoming summit","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University continues building momentum as America’s leading university in semiconductors, with a broad range of updates this fall semester.
Submitted through the Applied Research Institute, the Indiana-led proposal “Silicon Crossroads” was announced Sept. 20 by the Department of Defense as one of eight Microelectronics Commons Hubs selected out of over 80 proposals across the U.S. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), in Indiana will manage the program.
The hubs are the first major program funded through the CHIPS and Science Act 2022, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana. The total five-year budget is around $2 billion; FY23 is year 1 and has a budget of $238 million. The Indiana-led consortium, with participation from Illinois and Michigan, received $33 million as part of the year 1 budget and is the largest hub in the Midwest.
“Located in America’s heartland, Silicon Crossroads builds on the Midwest’s strengths in research and development as well as workforce training at all levels to build a domestic semiconductor industry — a national security imperative to keep our nation ahead of our adversaries,” said Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb.
“As we collectively work to grow the nation’s microelectronics base, Indiana will play a key role in the development of these critical national security technologies and capabilities,” Young said. “More broadly, this announcement shows how the CHIPS and Science Act will connect more of America, including the industrial Midwest, to the innovation economy.”
Indiana leads the Silicon Crossroads Hub, and as its leading university Purdue will collaborate with many members of the consortium in the coming years.
Purdue is also the university leading the Department of Defense workforce program SCALE, with a national consortium of 18 universities.

Seeing STARS: Purdue trains next generation of semiconductor engineers
Purdue is a national leader in microelectronics materials, devices, chip design, tool development, manufacturing, packaging and sustainability, spanning the semiconductor ecosystem in software and hardware with long-standing faculty excellence.
Strategic initiatives in semiconductors, such as the first comprehensive Semiconductor Degrees Program, which was announced before the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022, are intended to prepare a next-generation workforce for industry. Economic development and research collaboration followed as well, including from Skywater, MediaTek, and Belgium-based imec.
As part of Purdue Computes initiative, Purdue’s growing semiconductor innovation ecosystem includes $49 million in new facilities and tools for the Birck Nanotechnology Center, which will also be accessible by Ivy Tech, Indiana’s statewide community college and a local partner with Purdue in developing next-level workforce and brain gain strategies for Indiana.
Earlier this month, Purdue announced the creation of Purdue@Crane, a permanent Purdue presence for national security research collaboration with NSWC Crane, including participation in the WestfGate Foundry with companies such as Everspin Technologies and NHanced Semiconductors.
Purdue’s approach to semiconductors was spotlighted during a panel discussion between Purdue President Mung Chiang and Adrienne Elrod of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s CHIPS Program Office on Sept. 20 at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in New York City. The four-day festival, attended by thousands of the world’s most inventive thinkers, up-and-coming entrepreneurs and visionaries, showcases “creativity and groundbreaking ideas that are transforming industries.” Chiang and Elrod highlighted Purdue’s role in both workforce development and research innovation, with a rapidly growing ecosystem co-locating partners in the “heart of the Silicon Heartland.”
Next month Purdue will host a semiconductors summit through a sequence of events on campus:
On Oct. 17, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger will visit Purdue for a Presidential Lecture.
On Oct. 18, the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Alliance UPWARDS will kick off on the Purdue campus, where 11 universities in the U.S. and Japan along with Micron, Tokyo Electron Limited and the National Science Foundation will move forward the project signed in Hiroshima, Japan, at the G7 Summit in May.
On Oct. 19, Purdue, along with imec, the U.S.-Japan team and India Semiconductors Mission, with which Purdue signed a collaboration in May, will meet in West Lafayette to discuss long-term collaboration in semiconductor education, research and industry partnership.

Bringing home asteroids: Purdue scientist is among the first to examine asteroid pieces from NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
To study the planets, someone has to go there: Either a human or a bot launches into space to physically explore other worlds. Scientists who study extraterrestrial materials can’t usually bring their work home.
That’s exactly what’s happened this month, though, as NASA’s OSIRIS-REx project brought home pieces of the asteroid Bennu.

Still taking giant leaps from lunar small steps: Purdue scientists analyze moondust collected by Apollo 17 astronauts
This solar system rocks: Geologist studies asteroids and moondust to decode the history of the solar system
The culmination of more than a decade of work by a team of thousands, samples of the asteroid landed Sept. 24 in the Utah desert and were whisked off to a clean lab at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. There, Michelle Thompson, associate professor of earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences in Purdue’s College of Science, is one of the first six lead investigators from the science team — and the first woman — to study the samples. To protect the sample from contaminants, only the six scientists, clad in bunny suits, gloves, hoods, shoe covers and hair covers, are allowed in the room with the sample.
“This is a truly once-in-a-lifetime — maybe a once-in-several-lifetimes — experience,” Thompson said. “OSIRIS-REx was selected in 2011, the year I started my PhD, and launched in 2016, the year I got my PhD. It reached Bennu in 2018, the year I came to Purdue. And now I am going to be one of the first humans to get to study it. Bennu is a treasure trove of information; this is literally the project of my career.”
Two other missions, Hayabusa and Hayabusa2, both launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, have brought asteroid samples back to Earth. However, each of those missions returned much smaller amounts of sample material. Hayabusa brought back less than a milligram — approximately the weight of a single grain of granulated sugar — from the asteroid Itokawa. Hayabusa2 brought back 5.4 grams of material — about the weight of a nickel — from the asteroid Ryugu.
Scientists aren’t yet sure exactly how much material OSIRIS-REx has brought back, but its collection cannister appeared to be packed. The mission’s goal was to return 60 grams of sample. However, from camera observations, there may be more than 100 grams of material: about the weight of a stick of butter or a baby panda. The entire 100-pound capsule was shipped to the cleanroom lab; Thompson and her teammates will open it and measure what they find there.
What’s inside will be enough to keep hundreds of scientists busy for the length of their careers. But, along with five other colleagues, NASA selected Thompson to be one of the scientists to get the first look: They have 72 hours to analyze the samples to inform the science team and the public of their initial characterization.
Thompson is an expert in how asteroids, moons and other planetary bodies react with space — a process called space weathering. Understanding the surface, the very top few millimeters of rock and dust, called regolith, will shed light on the composition of asteroids and how their properties change and reflect their makeup. She has previously studied samples of moondust brought to Earth by the Apollo missions and has spent months at Johnson Space Center preparing for the asteroid samples’ arrival.
OSIRIS-REx’s name, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security — Regolith Explorer, encapsulates the program’s goal. Results will help give scientists insight into the origin of the planets and the earliest history of our solar system.
Studying an asteroid’s surface chemistry and how it compares to measurements and observations astronomers can make from Earth or orbital spacecraft will help scientists better understand how to interpret what they see.
“Observing asteroids from spacecraft and telescopes is incredibly important, but nothing can replace analyzing samples in the laboratory,” Thompson said. “Sample return missions are a cornerstone of planetary science, and this close-up look at Bennu material will give us details we couldn’t see from orbit and help us understand how to interpret what we’re seeing on other faraway asteroids. It makes our understanding more comprehensive, more three-dimensional.”
Other motivations include understanding what asteroids are made of to help future humans and explorers find whatever they might need to mine for future vehicles, missions and habitats. Scientists also hope to gain more understanding of asteroids’ physical chemistry and how its orbit is changing with time, particularly of asteroids like Bennu that come close to Earth — and even have a chance, however minuscule, of impacting Earth.
“Asteroids are relics of the early solar system,” Thompson said. “They’re like time capsules. We can use them to examine the origin of our solar system and to open a window to the origin of life on Earth.”
Bennu is a carbonaceous asteroid, which means that the element carbon — a fundamental building block of life — makes up a part of its composition. Like charcoal, a common carbonaceous material, many of these asteroids are dark and difficult to spot and see well in their entirety. Almost three-quarters of all asteroids are carbonaceous, so information gleaned from Bennu is likely to be applicable to many other asteroids in the solar system.
Of course, pieces of asteroids can fall to Earth on their own. It’s just that when they do, they don’t get here unscathed. Screaming through the friction of Earth’s atmosphere is a violent process, and not many rocks make it to the surface intact. If they do land in one piece, they can be altered and contaminated by the atmosphere and their surroundings on Earth.
Escorting the rock down, gently and insulated in still-pristine condition, using human innovation, means that scientists will get to look at the asteroid as it was in its original environment, lending understanding to a wide range of planetary science.
“These samples have been on their way back to us for a couple of years,” Thompson said. “We have had years to prepare for what we might find and how we might study the sample.”
Thompson’s expertise in the equipment and protocols of studying the chemistry of very small particles and rock samples gives her an edge in figuring out what elements and compounds make up Bennu’s surface and how that structure might have changed over the history of the solar system.
Earth and other large planets have volcanoes or plate tectonics that have shaped and reshaped their surfaces over the history of our solar system. Asteroids like Bennu have experienced minimal alteration since their formation over 4.5 billion years ago. Analyzing their composition gives scientists hints to what materials might have been present as the solar system and all the planets formed and as life began to move on the surface of Earth itself.
“Looking at the organic molecules from Bennu, we’re going to get an understanding of what kinds of molecules could have seeded life on early Earth,” Thompson said. “Information about what compounds, what elements are there, and in what proportions. We won’t find life itself, but we’re definitely looking at the building blocks that could have eventually evolved into life.”

Purdue’s online Dual Engineering + MBA and Management and Leadership master’s degree program proves to be a career booster,"summarize:About This Series: This story is part of an ongoing Purdue Today series highlighting programs ranked in the Top 10 or Top 10th percentile among our peers nationally, demonstrating the university’s persistent pursuit of excellence, innovation and transformative learning.
Two years after completing his bachelor’s degree, Januario Mendes wanted to upgrade his engineering skills while gaining business expertise that could position him to move into leadership as his career advances.
After some research, he decided that only one master’s program fit what he was looking for — Purdue University’s online Dual Master of Science in Engineering (MS/MSE) + Master of Business Administration (MBA). The Purdue program combines technical training in engineering with valuable management training, giving students the skills they need to confidently step into leadership positions at the intersection of engineering and business.
“Since graduating, I have transitioned into a more senior engineering role in which I gained managerial responsibilities,” says Mendes, who graduated in the fall of 2022 and is now a senior industrial engineer with Cummins Inc. in Columbus, Indiana. “My master’s degree has prepared and equipped me with the skills and knowledge required to help my peers and coach other fellow junior engineers.”
U.S. News: Best Online Master’s in Engineering Management Programs
Purdue Online Master’s Program in Engineering Management and Leadership
Purdue Online Interdisciplinary Dual MSE/MS + MBA
The dual master’s program is one reason Purdue has been ranked No. 1 in Best Online Master’s in Engineering Management programs by U.S. News and World Report for two years running, the latest for 2023 announced in January. Purdue’s overall online graduate engineering program also has consistently been among the top three programs by U.S. News and ranked No. 2 in 2023.
In addition to the dual degree program, Purdue offers an online interdisciplinary master’s degree (MSE/MS) with a concentration in engineering management and leadership, designed for professionals who want to move into team lead- or project management-type positions but don’t feel the need for a full MBA.
“There’s a common need for technical engineers as they move into management and supervisory positions to expand out beyond their engineering courses,” says John Fassnacht, principal managing director of online programs for Purdue’s College of Engineering.
According to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, the engineering management job market is projected to grow 2% through 2031 with a median salary exceeding $150,000. Earning an advanced degree provides a competitive edge for engineers looking to advance to management and supervisory roles.
Employers also are looking for engineers with interdisciplinary skill sets. Communication and business acumen, both emphasized in Purdue’s programs, are two particularly important skills often overlooked by traditional engineering programs.
Austin Nagy originally enrolled in Purdue’s online engineering management and leadership master’s program because his employer at the time, General Motors, sponsored it. But Nagy, who graduated in spring 2022, stayed with it even after he changed employers because he felt Purdue had established a high-quality online program. That persistence has paid off for Nagy, who is now an advanced manufacturing engineering manager at Lear Corp. in Phoenix.
“As I was finishing my degree, I was able to negotiate a promotion at my current company from quality engineer to quality manager,” Nagy says. “From a networking perspective, I do find many more recruiters reach out to me for job opportunities.”
Besides such material benefits, completing Purdue’s program has been a win from a professional development perspective for Nagy.
“Furthering my education has given me a seat at every table in the company,” Nagy says. “My perspectives on management and corporate strategy have changed significantly, and I find more and more employees reaching out for consultation. From a purely technical standpoint, I find myself able to not only participate but lead in almost all technical operations decisions we make.”
The bottom line, Nagy says: “The Purdue program was fun and a good investment in myself.”",[{'summary_text': 'the Purdue program combines technical training in engineering with valuable management training . the overall online graduate engineering program has consistently been among the top three programs by U.S. News and ranked No. 2 in 2023 .'}]

SECURE 2.0 retirement changes to impact Purdue retirement programs,"summarize:Human Resources would like to make employees aware of key retirement changes effective as part of SECURE 2.0 — legislation designed to expand access and improve retirement savings for individuals.
In 9 ways SECURE 2.0 could impact you, Fidelity provides an overview of key SECURE 2.0 retirement changes now in effect or slated for future years. While there are many required and optional provisions included in the law, a few of those required changes impact participants in Purdue’s retirement programs.
Here are SECURE 2.0 highlights to know now:
The required age to begin taking RMDs (required minimum distributions) has increased to age 73 in 2023 and will increase again to age 75 in 2033.
Starting in 2024, RMDs will no longer be required from Roth accounts in employer retirement plans.
The penalty for failing to take an RMD has decreased from 50% to 25% of the RMD amount.
These changes are welcome news for many retirement plan participants approaching RMD age. This increase in required age will allow participants the ability to keep retirement savings in their retirement plan longer, allowing the funds the opportunity for additional growth while remaining in the plan. The reduced penalty will also allow participants to preserve more of their retirement income should they fail to take their RMD in a timely manner.
An additional requirement, originally set to begin in 2024, will require all employee catch-up contributions — for individuals aged 50 and above earning $145,000 or more in the prior year — to be designated as Roth contributions only. The IRS has since released guidance extending the deadline to implement until 2026. The extension will allow additional time to comply with this new requirement.
Purdue continues to assess the impact of this wide-sweeping legislation, as many SECURE 2.0 provisions are complex and the university awaits additional guidance from the IRS and other governmental entities. More information will be shared as relevant updates become available.
To learn more about these changes, employees may schedule an appointment with a Fidelity retirement planner by calling 800-642-7131 or scheduling online. For more information on what to expect from a consultation with a Fidelity retirement planner supporting Purdue’s retirement plans, see the video “Retirement Planning — How You Benefit From a Fidelity Consultation.”

Purdue center addresses pressing challenge of securing semiconductor chips,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University’s emergence as a leader in semiconductor chips also requires it to usher in a new level of security that protects those essential chips needed for everything from your car and cellphone to artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The Center for Secure Microelectronics Ecosystem (CSME) at Purdue is tackling that challenge by developing the latest advances to protect today’s and tomorrow’s microelectronics and semiconductors. The center will hold its annual meeting Sept. 26-27 with university partners and industry sponsors, highlighting the research that connects the multi-institutional academic community with semiconductor industry leaders and the U.S. Department of Defense to safeguard economic and national security interests. This year’s annual summit will have a number of industry representatives in attendance and feature over 30 student research presentations and posters.

Security in computer systems and electronics often revolves around software, but the underlying microelectronics have the same potential to be hacked. Purdue College of Engineering faculty and programs lead the effort for better security through research advances in microelectronics. CSME is addressing security challenges through grants funded by the center’s industrial and government partners for research projects across the nation.
“Initial chip design, fabrication and the final packaging into circuit boards is spread out across not only companies but also countries now,” said Joerg Appenzeller, CSME co-director and Purdue’s Barry M. and Patricia L. Epstein Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “This center ensures the semiconductor industry will be more resilient and prepared for security challenges, both large and small.”
CSME was announced in spring 2022 as a part of Purdue’s continued leadership in semiconductors. It is joined by university partners Arizona State, the University of Florida, Texas A&M and Georgia Tech. The center launched with support from founding companies TSMC and Synopsys in conjunction with support through a DOD-funded workforce development program.
TSMC announced an extension of its partnership with Purdue in June.
For CSME, the microelectronics supply chain represents as much potential for security issues as other considerations, which oftentimes means researchers are tackling problems akin to looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.
“Hardware security threats range from recycling older components as new, counterfeit parts to  accidental or deliberate modifications to hardware that leaks sensitive information or causes malfunction in the field, to name a few,” said Anand Raghunathan, CSME co-director and the Silicon Valley Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “Our researchers are pursuing advances that will ensure a secure microelectronics ecosystem by eliminating traditional and emerging security attacks.”
Purdue is a national leader in microelectronics research, spanning the semiconductor ecosystem in software and hardware. CSME is one of six major centers serving as anchors for that work, with a number of ongoing research projects focusing on various aspects of design, packaging and reliability.
Semiconductor and workforce development work by CSME represents a pillar of the recently announced Purdue Computes. The initiative amplifies the university’s dominant position today in education, research and industry partnerships in semiconductors. Under Purdue Computes, $100 million of semiconductor facilities are planned, including upgrades to the Birck Nanotechnology Center.
CSME recognizes the need for new generations of skilled professionals to advance semiconductor security. As part of its workforce development efforts, the center works with graduate and undergraduate students, posing and answering scientific questions of relevance to a secure microelectronics supply chain.
That follows workforce development as a continued focus of the university through the first comprehensive Semiconductor Degrees Program and the Purdue-led SCALE (Scalable Asymmetric Lifecycle Engagement) microelectronics workforce development program.
CSME will provide research projects ripe for graduate students in SCALE, who will form the future workforce prepared to address the challenges of designing secure microelectronics.
Global connections to advance semiconductor research and workforce development have been a persistent pursuit at Purdue, which has established several international partnerships.
On May 21 Purdue President Mung Chiang signed a landmark international agreement during the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. Chiang signed another agreement in May for Purdue to become the flagship academic partner and collaborator with the government of India. In addition, Purdue, the state of Indiana and the Indiana Economic Development Corp. announced a partnership May 3 with imec, a Belgium-based semiconductor research and development firm.

Purdue Global grad: ‘Dreams really do come true. This was my chance to make it happen’,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Kerry Bruso has always been a performer. She started dancing when she was 3 years old and says it’s always been the thing that lights her up.
“It’s extremely empowering,” she says. “It fills your whole soul.”
Bruso, who earned her MBA from Purdue Global in May, was an academic force to be reckoned with. The Bel Air, Maryland, resident graduated from a highly competitive magnet high school program, the Science and Mathematics Academy. She went on to get her bachelor’s degree in dance performance from Oklahoma City University in 2017 and became a dancer at Walt Disney World.
While most people wouldn’t think of a master’s in business administration as something that could advance a dancer’s career, Bruso saw an opportunity.
When she learned about what a Disney World choreographer does and how it could be in her future, she knew this was the smart way to look ahead. But it wouldn’t be a simple path and definitely not an easy one.
Soon after graduating from Purdue Global — where she sang the national anthem at her commencement ceremony — she was promoted and moved into the choreographer role.
“I am absolutely loving my new job and feel so grateful to be living a dream of mine,” she says. “It’s hard to say goodbye to performing, but hopefully, it’s not necessarily a goodbye. I have so many other dreams and passions other than dance. At this point in my life, my passion and drive to help empower others is much stronger than my passion for performing.”

"Treatment for mental health conditions, substance use disorders covered by health insurance policies same as physical illness","summarize:In 2008, Congress passed the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act to ensure equal coverage of treatment for mental illness and addiction. The federal government released rules to implement the law in 2013, which substantially improved coverage for mental health. Prior to the law, treatment for mental health conditions was typically at far lower levels in health insurance policies than for physical illness. The act aligns with the behavioral health pillar of the Healthy Boiler Program.
The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act provides for parity in the application of aggregate treatment limitations (day or visit limits) on mental health and substance abuse benefits with day/visit limits on medical/surgical benefits. In general, group health plans offering mental health and substance abuse benefits cannot set day/visit limits on mental health or substance abuse benefits that are lower than any such day/visit limits for medical and surgical benefits. A plan that does not impose day/visit limits on medical and surgical benefits may not impose such day/visit limits on mental health and substance abuse benefits offered under the plan. Also, the plan may not impose deductibles, copayment/coinsurance and out-of-pocket expenses on mental health and substance abuse benefits that are more restrictive than deductibles, copayment/coinsurance and out-of-pocket expenses applicable to other medical and surgical benefits.
Mental health parity and addiction equity means the equal treatment of mental health conditions and substance use disorders in insurance plans. When a plan has parity, as all of Purdue’s health plans do, it means that if someone is provided unlimited doctor visits for a chronic condition such as diabetes, then unlimited visits for a mental health condition such as depression or schizophrenia must also be provided. In short, an individual’s health plan must treat mental health and addiction conditions the same as a medical condition.
Purdue’s health plan coverage for mental health conditions and substance use disorders includes medication, office visits, testing, and in-patient and outpatient treatment. In addition, Purdue’s prescription coverage does not specifically exclude any drug categories for mental health.
In-person and telehealth visits are both covered as part of Purdue’s plans.
LiveHealth Online behavioral health costs are as follows:
$80 for therapist/social worker
$95 for psychology
$175 for psychiatry new patient visit
$75 for any follow-up psychiatry visits
Additionally, as long as the provider is in-network, any online behavior health visit (not just with LiveHealth Online) would be covered. The member will pay out of pocket until they meet their deductible.
To help employees find tier 1 (HealthSync) or tier 2 (in-network) behavioral health care providers, Human Resources has created a list of behavioral health referrals.
A breakdown of insurance coverage for alcohol/substance abuse and mental health can be found here.
While the parity requirement doesn’t apply to leaves, Purdue University leaves pertain to time off if an employee is unable to work due to a mental health condition or substance use disorder; therefore, the employee may be eligible to apply for leave just the same as if they could not work due to a medical condition.

Mars region offers NASA rover environment to search for evidence of ancient microbial life,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University scientist Briony Horgan is leading NASA’s Mars rover into unfamiliar territory as the mission turns toward its next opportunity to find ancient signs of life on the red planet.
The rover Perseverance is searching for evidence of ancient microbial life in Mars’ rock record in deposits along the margin areas around Jezero Crater, where the rover initially landed. Any life that once existed on the red planet may have left behind chemical clues that Horgan hopes can still be found in the deposits as part of the rover’s “margin campaign.”

Horgan said the new region could be like a “bathtub ring” that extends around up to a third of the crater’s inner margin. Orbital data suggest it is filled with deposits of carbonate minerals, comparable to different shoreline or beach areas on Earth. Carbonates offer the potential to hold and preserve evidence of life that may have existed in the shallow water believed to have been along the shoreline area.
Horgan said the rover mission arrived in the margin region this week and has just started collecting samples.
The rover landed in February 2021 in Jezero Crater, just north of the Martian equator. The crater used to contain a lake about the size of Lake Tahoe. Horgan led a study of the mineralogy of the site, which produced one of the results that contributed to the selection of Jezero Crater for the mission.
Horgan has assumed the role of campaign science co-lead for this portion of the mission, given her expertise in geology. Horgan has worked as long-term planner as part of the science leadership team for Perseverance. Co-lead for this part of the mission is Brad Garczynski, one of Horgan’s doctoral students.
The margin area is one of the main exploration targets for the mission, which has been ongoing for more than two and a half years. Horgan said it’s expected that Perseverance will explore the margin area until May, with plans to also examine a river channel that cut through the rim of Jezero Crater and was the source of the delta deposits. The rover is expected to collect samples of carbonate from the margin region.
The shoreline carbonate isn’t the only feature to be investigated during this part of the mission.  Perseverance also will attempt to find igneous rocks that have been altered to form carbonate, providing an opportunity to address additional astrobiological and environmental aspects of Mars’ geological record.
Carbonate minerals commonly form in certain bodies of water on Earth when the water chemistry favors their precipitation. The process can be mediated, or the precipitation of minerals caused, by the action of microorganisms that inhabit the water.
“Normally, we see carbonates forming on Earth in very shallow water, and they are great for trapping signs of microbial activity because these shallow zones are fed by light and nutrients coming in,” Horgan said. While some microorganisms are photosynthetic and can use sunlight as a metabolic energy source, others can feed on certain chemicals present.
Horgan said the team will closely examine the textures of the carbonate to determine the potential it holds for signs of life.
This is the latest step for the Mars rover mission, which began with a July 2020 launch and 300-million-mile trip through space. The mission is intended to last until the Mars Sample Return mission lands, close to 2030.

Purdue developing field test to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in dozens of host species,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University has received $2.7 million in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to develop a field test that can measure and predict the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in a wide range of wildlife and farm animals.
“We’re hoping to develop one protocol and that the test works universally,” said Mohit Verma, assistant professor in agricultural and biological engineering and the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. Verma and his colleagues plan to collect nearly 2,000 nasal and oral samples from more than three dozen species of mammals and birds ranging from cattle, swine and wolves to chickens, ducks and turkeys.
The project team includes Purdue’s Arezoo Ardekani, professor of mechanical engineering; Gregory Fraley, the Terry and Sandra Tucker Endowed Chair of Poultry Science; Jonathan (Alex) Pasternak, assistant professor of animal sciences; Jon Schoonmaker, associate professor of animal sciences; and Patrick Zollner, professor of quantitative ecology in forestry and natural resources.
They will work with additional collaborators at Purdue and other universities and at APHIS, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Great Lakes Indian Wildlife Commission and Wolf Park near Battle Ground, Indiana. Additional partners are the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society, Indiana State Poultry Association and Midwest Poultry Consortium.
The team’s goal is to provide a simple and affordable way for animal and public health agencies in tribal, state, federal and private lands to track transmission of the virus as it potentially spreads between different animal species and humans. The testing would be suitable for settings ranging from hunting, trapping and animal production to veterinary clinics and at home.
The project spans both hardware and software components. The hardware is the test for field use. The software is for uploading the results to a dashboard to monitor spread of the virus in different animals and locations.
APHIS and its partners completed studies that showed the virus spread to various animal species, wildlife included. For white-tailed deer, their research conducted in 2021 revealed that approximately 40% of the samples contained SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, suggesting that the virus was circulating in the states that were evaluated.
“There is a potential for COVID-19 to be resident in animals and then spill back to humans,” Verma said. “That’s the concern, and that can happen. That’s why we are developing better tools for surveillance in wildlife, companion animals and farm animals.”
The problem disproportionally affects tribal nations, whose members maintain close contact with wildlife both for subsistence and cultural reasons. An April 2022 Congressional
hearing on “Preventing Pandemics through U.S. Wildlife-borne Disease Surveillance” highlighted the need to involve tribal nations in the process. Likewise, the Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Geological Survey could use better surveillance tools to help guide outdoors enthusiasts nationally.
“We thought about what could be the most universal and could still be used in the field across different users,” Verma said. The team settled on oral-nasal swabs because they can sample what often is a shared cavity in animals.
The team will focus on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but the tools could apply to other viruses and emerging diseases as needed. The project will build off Verma’s ongoing work in animal and human health. Verma has already developed innovative paper-based, rapid-result tests for bovine respiratory disease and COVID-19 and is in the process of commercializing these through his startup Krishi Inc.
“We’re hoping that the tools we develop will be amendable to low-resource use and can be deployed widely,” Verma said. The availability of results could be reduced from one day to an hour at a cost of about $10 per test.
A key goal will be to improve the test’s sensitivity. Because it was designed to be simple and user-friendly, the test Verma developed for humans was less sensitive than laboratory-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests. Both animal size and the rate of virus replication determine the needed sensitivity level, he noted. Many animals not yet susceptible may become susceptible if the virus mutates.
“A lot of this is not known. We are comparing ourselves to what we can do in the lab,” he said. “If you take the same sample, do all the purification and extraction in the lab, then do this qPCR test, what levels can you get?”
Ideally, the team will develop a test sensitive to the virus at low levels, even before an animal begins showing clinical signs.
Project funding stems from the American Rescue Plan Act for work focusing on the One Health Concept, which recognizes the link between the health of people, animals and the environment. It builds on initial seed support provided by Purdue University College of Agriculture through its 2030 Idea Challenge. The project leverages previous developments supported by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, Raytheon BBN Technologies and USDA APHIS.

Inkjet-printed tumors: Custom cancer drug testbeds in less than a day,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Cancer researchers often require live tumors to test their new treatments. But harvesting live tumors is painful and dangerous, and creating new tumors in a lab can be time-consuming and difficult. Purdue University researchers have developed a novel solution: inkjet-printed tumors. The researchers print biomaterial in a unique two-dimensional pattern, and these specimens naturally fold in on themselves to become lifelike three-dimensional tumoroids, in a process called morphogenesis.

Planning a campus event? An emergency preparedness checklist is available for event planners,"summarize:Emergency Preparedness and Planning is encouraging departments, student groups and others to utilize an emergency planning checklist to prepare for special events.
The Special Event Emergency Preparedness and Planning Checklist is available under the “Resources” tab on the Emergency Preparedness and Planning website. The checklist serves as a guide for student, staff and faculty event organizers to follow when planning on-campus events. It offers guidance on several topics that should be considered, including security, weather and fire safety.
“My office has had event organizers ask what they should do or where to begin when planning a campus event,” said Jefferson Howells, director of Emergency Preparedness and Planning. “The goal of this checklist is to serve as one central resource for all their planning needs.”
The checklist includes information for various departments and groups that should be contacted during the planning process. It also includes links to track weather forecasts, a link for a food service application, a link to apply to use a drone, as well as several other resources. Howells says the checklist continues to grow.
“Purdue has been fortunate to host several different kinds of events on campus throughout the years,” Howells said. “The list has been modified over time as the university gains experience with the various events. The list not only helps meet the needs of event organizers, but also provides resources to conduct safe and reliable operations.”
Howells said his office does not need to approve the checklist for each event, but he encourages event organizers to fill it out and consider it a valuable tool.
Emergency Preparedness and Planning is part of the Administrative Operations organization. The organization supports the university by providing safe, reliable and transformative services. Providing proactive planning resources to support safety during campus events is just one of the ways the organization helps power Purdue.

That overall score placed Purdue’s value ahead of the University of California, Berkeley; Harvard University; the University of Texas at Austin; and UCLA, among others. The formula uniquely ranked universities state by state as well, placing Purdue No. 1 in the state of Indiana over the University of Notre Dame (75.14), Wabash College (74.58) and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (72.83).
With the core pillar of excellence at scale in mind, Purdue University’s Board of Trustees voted in June to again freeze tuition, this time for the 11th and 12th consecutive years. By 2024-25, 10 Purdue graduating classes will have never experienced a tuition increase during their time in West Lafayette. Meanwhile, more students than ever are seeking a Purdue degree, as 72,600 applied for undergraduate admission for the fall 2023 semester, and more employers than ever are seeking out Purdue graduates.
SmartAsset’s Best Value ranking comes on the heels of Purdue’s best-ever showing of No. 43 overall (No. 17 among public universities) in U.S. News & World Report’s 2024 Best College rankings, along with several other recent prominent accolades:
Purdue scored a top 10 placement among U.S. public universities and ranked No. 27 among all U.S. universities in the QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) World University rankings in June, which includes both undergraduate and graduate/research components.

"Purdue University undergraduate national ranking jumps 8 spots, with 13 undergraduate programs in top 10 in the US","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
At No. 43 overall among 435 universities ranked in the country, Purdue captured its best-ever undergraduate ranking by U.S. News & World Report as it improved its position from No. 51 last year.
The 2024 U.S. News rankings released Sept. 18 were calculated using 19 key measures of undergraduate academic quality for national universities. Each school’s ranking factors were calculated and compared with the mean and standard deviation values of other schools to create a normalized score. In particular, Purdue earned high marks in percentage of full-time faculty, in reputation among peers, and in a new metric that measures graduates’ earning potential. Purdue’s peer assessment score is ranked No. 35 in the U.S. Many undergraduate programs in terms of colleges and departments are also ranked nationally at the same time. U.S. News typically releases its graduate and research rankings every spring. Other international rankings have different methodologies and cover undergraduate, graduate and research all in one.
“While any single ranking is bound to be noisy and partial, the latest U.S. News undergraduate ranking is yet another reflection of the hard work by our students, faculty and staff,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “Excellence at scale is measurable in many ways, one of which is how a broad range of metrics and peer assessments continues to move up for Purdue’s undergraduate programs.”
Purdue Agricultural and Biological Engineering undergraduate program ranked first in US
Purdue University ascends to the top 10 of the Global University Visibility rankings
Purdue scores in top 10 among US public universities in QS world rankings
Purdue engineering graduate program ranked in the top 2% nationally, 4th among more than 200 universities in the US
Purdue was also named the No. 7 Most Innovative university, as the new U.S. News & World Report undergraduate ranking extends Purdue’s streak to six consecutive years as a top 10 Most Innovative school in the nation.
Purdue’s renowned College of Engineering moved up one spot to No. 8 in collegewide undergraduate rankings (its 2023 graduate ranking was No. 4 in the U.S.), with departmental rankings up across the board to their best showing in decades. Seven departments are ranked among the top 10, with five of them improving year over year and industrial and mechanical engineering remaining strong:
Agricultural and biological engineering: No. 1 in the U.S.
Industrial engineering: No. 2 in the U.S.
Aeronautics and astronautics: No. 3 in the U.S. (historic high)
Civil engineering: No. 4 in the U.S.
Mechanical engineering: No. 6 in the U.S.
Computer engineering: No. 7 in the U.S. (historic high)
Electrical engineering: No. 8 in the U.S.
In the Department of Computer Science (joint across the College of Science and College of Engineering) — which along with computer engineering is a part of the Purdue Computes initiative — two programs are ranked among the top 10, and both moved up year over year:
Cybersecurity: No. 6 in the U.S.
Software engineering: No. 8 in the U.S.
The newly reimagined Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business jumped nine spots, placing at No. 21 among undergraduate business programs in the country. The Daniels School of Business also has three programs that either improved to join the top 10 or remained there:
Operations management: No. 8 in the U.S.
Supply chain: No. 10 in the U.S.
Quantitative analysis: No. 10 in the U.S.
“Our consistent climb across a variety of national rankings reflects an enhanced focus on scholarly excellence, which further strengthens our land-grant mission,” said Patrick J. Wolfe, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity. “Agility combined with excellence at scale is a critical driver of our continued success, and so we’re especially proud to be named one of America’s Most Innovative universities for the sixth year running.”

Purdue researcher awarded $1.3 million for malaria drug trials in Southeast Asia and Africa,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A Purdue researcher is taking a giant leap forward in the fight against drug-resistant strains of malaria in developing countries.
Open Philanthropy has awarded $1.38 million to Philip Low to further validate a drug therapy that he and his colleagues have previously shown to successfully treat the disease. Low (rhymes with “now”) is Purdue University’s Presidential Scholar for Drug Discovery and the Ralph C. Corley Distinguished Professor of Chemistry in the College of Science.
For years, experts have been concerned about the rise of drug-resistant malaria variants in Southeast Asia and the prospect that one or more of these strains might travel to Africa. A similar event occurred in the 1980s with the emergence of drug resistance to the then-standard treatment of chloroquine, which resulted in millions of deaths.
But Low is working to save lives on both continents by conducting clinical trials to validate previous results and to test whether the number of days of an anti-malaria treatment can be reduced.
While studying how malaria propagates in human blood, Low and his research team discovered that the cancer drug therapy imatinib is effective in the treatment of drug-resistant malaria. Trials in Southeast Asia showed that imatinib, when combined with the customary malaria therapy, clears all malaria parasites from 90% of patients within 48 hours and 100% of patients within three days. The patients receiving imatinib were also relieved of their fevers in less than half of the time experienced by similar patients treated with the standard therapy.
Open Philanthropy has awarded Low $600,000 for a larger clinical trial in Southeast Asia to validate his previous trials. The organization has also awarded Low $780,000 to determine whether the usual three-day therapy can be reduced to two days or even one. This work will be focused in the African countries of Kenya and Tanzania where malaria is prominent.
“We found that people in Africa must often walk many miles to obtain treatment for malaria. They will receive three pills, walk all the way home, take one or two pills, start to feel better, and then save the third pill for their next malaria infection,” Low said. “When they don’t finish the course of treatment, only the most drug-resistant strains of the parasite survive and spread. And that’s how people build up drug resistance. So we’d like to eventually be able to cure all patients with just one pill. It would prevent these drug-resistant strains from ever proliferating.”
Open Philanthropy is a grantmaking organization whose mission is to use its resources to help others as much as it can, according to the funder.
“This is yet another case of an organization recognizing Philip Low’s brilliance, scientific vision and mission to help people in all corners of the world,” said Brooke Beier, senior vice president of Purdue Innovates. “The Purdue Research Foundation has been a proud partner in supporting his work, protecting and promoting his intellectual property that is changing lives and making our world a better place to live.”
Since 1988, Low has been listed on more than 145 invention disclosures to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization. He has been listed on more than 600 patents in nearly two dozen countries around the world from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and international patent organizations. During his tenure at Purdue, Low has been awarded 213 research grants for more than $43.5 million. His work also receives support from the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research and the Purdue Institute for Drug Discovery.
Imatinib was originally produced by Novartis for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and other cancers. It works by blocking specific enzymes involved in the growth of cancers.
“When we discovered the ability of imatinib to block parasite propagation in human blood cultures in petri dishes, we initiated a human clinical trial where we combined imatinib with the standard treatment (piperaquine plus dihydroartemisinin) used to treat malaria in much of the world,” Low said.
Malaria infects human red blood cells, where it reproduces and eventually activates a red blood cell enzyme that in turn triggers rupture of the cell and release of a form of the parasite called a merozoite into the bloodstream. Low and his colleagues theorized that by blocking the critical red blood cell enzyme, they could stop the infection. The data from initial drug trials have confirmed that.
“Because we’re targeting an enzyme that belongs to the red blood cell, the parasite can’t mutate to develop resistance — it simply can’t mutate our proteins in our blood cells,” Low said. “This is a novel approach that will hopefully become a therapy that can’t be evaded by the parasite in the future. This would constitute an important contribution to human health.”
The goal, Low said, is to get this into developing countries to save lives. With this new round of funding, he says they’re now closer than they’ve ever been.

Purdue welcomes its most selective incoming class,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University is welcoming its most selective class of incoming students for the 2023-24 academic year, marking a ninth consecutive record-breaking year of undergraduate applicants and enrollments, and another overall record for the number of graduate and undergraduate students. This year’s incoming undergraduate class was selected at a 50% admission rate — 3 percentage points lower than last year — from among 72,800 applicants.
“The Class of 2027 is the most selective drawn from the largest pool of undergraduate applicants since the Common App was used at Purdue,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “We also welcome master’s and doctorate students who are arriving to the largest graduate student enrollment on record. Excellence at scale is truly reflected in our students.”
Propelled by a string of strong rising national and global rankings reflecting its heightened academic profile, a sustained commitment to affordability from a dozen years of frozen tuition, and the resultant record applicant numbers, total enrollment at Purdue’s West Lafayette campus has reached an all-time high of 52,211 students this semester, including 47,889 in residence at West Lafayette.
Driven by scholarly excellence, this figure includes a record 39,170 undergraduates from all 50 states and over 120 countries as well as 12,136 graduate students, the most ever, pursuing advanced degrees — up 42% over the past decade. Another 905 students are pursuing professional degrees.
Undergraduate applications increased nearly 7% this year to 72,800 — and have surged 82% from 40,025 since 2013 when Common App was adopted. That has powered a 34% jump in total undergraduate enrollment since the 2014-15 academic year.
As West Lafayette student numbers approach a plateau and construction begins on new student housing projects recently approved by Purdue’s Board of Trustees, this year’s incoming class of undergraduate beginners is 9,285 — intentionally smaller than the record incoming class of 10,191 set in 2021. On average, this year’s incoming student reports a 3.78 GPA, its highest level in 15 years.
Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Diversity Patrick Wolfe said, “Our decade-long push to enhance scholarly excellence at Purdue while maintaining affordability and access has proved a winning strategy. I’m especially proud that our enrollment of students from underrepresented groups has reached its highest count and proportion — 6,215, or 12% of total enrollment — in at least a decade. This reflects the strides being made by our faculty through Purdue’s $75 million Equity Task Force initiative, launched in 2020 by our Board of Trustees.”
Purdue Data Digest
2022: Purdue sets all-time student enrollment record in West Lafayette
University residence to further increase availability of on-campus housing
Trustees approve 1,000 beds for student housing
Purdue’s College of Engineering and College of Science received over 22,000 and 18,000 applicants, respectively, followed by the newly reimagined Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business with over 7,300 applicants. Health and Human Sciences exceeded 7,000 applications for the first time, while the Purdue Polytechnic Institute and Liberal Arts received over 5,100 and 4,600 applications, respectively. More than 3,200 prospective students applied directly to Exploratory Studies, over 2,000 to Agriculture and more than 600 to Education, with undergraduate programs in Pharmacy and Veterinary Medicine drawing an additional 1,400 applicants in total.
Purdue’s record graduate enrollment includes over 5,200 residential PhD students across 84 subjects, more than 3,600 master’s students enrolled through Purdue University Online and nearly 3,000 residential master’s students, among others.
Professional programs at Purdue also continue to flourish and to strengthen; one sustained high point among several is Purdue’s Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. Applications there have risen more than 200% the past decade to 1,749, with 99 offers extended this year prior to the national acceptance date of April 15, and an enrollment of 84 new students — making it far and away one of Purdue’s most competitive and in-demand programs.
With affordability and accessibility at the forefront of its mission and buoyed by nearly a decade of record enrollment totals, Purdue has kept tuition at $9,992 per year for Indiana residents and $28,794 for out-of-state students for 12 consecutive years since 2012-13.
In tandem with that sustained effort, one-year loan borrowing per Purdue undergraduate has decreased by 40% since 2012. And with tuition unchanged at least through the 2024-25 school year, savings for Boilermaker students and their families will have totaled more than $1 billion for educational and living expenses, versus what they would have paid if Purdue had raised tuition and fees at the national average. And annual in-state tuition would be $1,400 higher today if Purdue had followed the national trend.
Seventy-five percent of Indiana resident applicants were offered admission to Purdue’s flagship West Lafayette campus this year, while nearly all others received offers of admission elsewhere within the Purdue system.
The land-grant university’s enhanced national profile also continues to play a major role in driving enrollment to record levels:
Purdue boasts 42 academic programs and specialties — 29 graduate and 13 undergraduate — ranked in the top 10 or top 10th percentile by U.S. News & World Report. Highlights include the No. 1 graduate programs in analytical chemistry and in agricultural and biological engineering and the No. 1 online master’s programs in electrical engineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering and engineering management.
QS World University rankings listed Purdue at No. 27 overall in the U.S. and No. 10 among U.S. public universities in 2024, up three spots from 2023. Purdue also was No. 99 among 1,500 global universities, rising 30 spots from 2023 to return to the top 100.
Purdue was recognized as a top 10 U.S. public university by The Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education in 2022. The rankings examined student outcomes, including graduates’ salaries and debt; academic resources such as how much is spent on teaching; student engagement and how students feel equipped for the real world; and learning environments, including diversity of the student body and academic staff.

Purdue president partners with students to create official university ice cream,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University will unveil its newly developed Boiler Chips ice cream and One Giant Scoop vanilla Saturday for football fans at the Sept. 16 game at Ross-Ade Stadium.
“It’s no secret that I love a good scoop of ice cream and the Old Gold and Black,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “This ice cream embodies the Purdue spirit. We are thrilled to reestablish the original Purdue Creamery vanilla recipe in One Giant Scoop, while also introducing the new Boiler Chips that was developed by the FEMI team in the College of Agriculture and tested by the Boiler Gold Rush students and group leaders. Thanks to all the Boilermakers involved. It tastes like victory!”
Students from the Food Entrepreneurship and Manufacturing Institute (FEMI) in the College of Agriculture’s food science department developed Boiler Chips, a new caramel chocolate chip flavor, and oversaw the production of One Giant Scoop, using the original vanilla recipe from the Purdue University Creamery, which closed in 1969. Partnering with Glover’s Ice Cream in Frankfort, Indiana, FEMI students were able to assist in the mass-scale production of the eight-ounce retail cups.
A portion of Glover’s proceeds from sales of the new ice cream flavors will provide funding to food science students for professional development opportunities. The ice cream will also be sold in the Purdue Memorial Union Boilermaker Market and through Purdue Food Co.’s catering operations.

Allow extra processing time for driver authorization requests,"summarize:Due to the high volume of Request for Driver Authorization (Form RM01) being submitted to the Office of Risk Management since the beginning of the academic year, individuals should note that processing is taking longer than normal.
Until the volume of requests subsides, allow two weeks for a request to be reviewed and approved. Requests from drivers with non-Indiana issued licenses may take a bit longer to process. Travelers should confirm travel plans and driver rosters in advance to allow for this increased processing time.
To help expedite the process, drivers should be sure that address information submitted on the RM01 matches address information shown on their driver’s license. Listing any address information other than what is on the driver’s license will cause additional processing delays.
Requests are typically processed in the order received. If a traveler has previously submitted an RM01 that has not yet been approved and travel is within the next five days, contact riskmgmt@purdue.edu and provide the name of any driver who still needs approval and the date they will be traveling. Requests that are submitted late will not be expedited.","[{'summary_text': 'Until the volume of requests subsides, allow two weeks for a request to be reviewed and approved . requests from drivers with non-Indiana issued licenses may take a bit longer to process .'}]"

Cracking the science of collagen in bones,"summarize:INDIANAPOLIS —
For over a century, the science around bones has been rooted only in whatever an X-ray image was able to reveal. Bone research solely focused on mineral content through radiation images, limiting the understanding about many other aspects of bone — collagen, water, fat — which don’t show up on a scan.
Purdue engineer Joey Wallace is fracturing the decadeslong status quo in bone research. His findings may provide unprecedented clarity into the underlying causes of conditions like osteoporosis, diabetes and kidney disease, health concerns that impact millions of Americans.
“People look at bone and they think it’s this static, inert thing that’s just there to let us move, and it’s the muscles, tendons and ligaments that are doing everything,” said Wallace, the biomedical engineering chair and professor at Purdue University in Indianapolis. “But bones are crazy complex.”
Purdue Expert Joey Wallace: Kidney Disease and Bones
Purdue University in Indianapolis: Launching Purdue’s first comprehensive urban campus and forming America’s Hard Tech Corridor
Purdue University, High Alpha partner to house programs in downtown Indianapolis
Early in his research of skeletal disease and mechanobiology — mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to mechanical signals — Wallace learned that those complex elements of bone weren’t being properly accounted for.
“It became immediately clear to me that some of the changes we were seeing in the mechanical properties of bone as it relates to fracture risk were happening in something that wasn’t being reflected in mineral,” Wallace said. “It wasn’t showing up as changes in bone mass, either, and if it’s not mineral, I knew I had to go down that rabbit hole to find out what it was.”
As Wallace continued to study, he began focusing on collagen in bone.
“I didn’t want to just see the collagen in normal tissues,” Wallace said. “I wanted to quantify it.”
That’s exactly what Wallace did, building a new identification technique around atomic force microscopy — which had previously only been dabbled with observationally — to image collagen in bone tissue. He developed the innovative technique to process bone and dentin samples to expose the underlying collagen, as well as quantify the nanoscale collagen structure. Wallace then used those processes to investigate differences in collagen structure in bone from a model of osteoporosis, differences as a function of tissue type and differences that existed in a model of osteogenesis imperfecta, a disease in which bones fracture easily, often with no obvious cause.
Studying how collagen impacts bone disease was a springboard for Wallace, bringing new data to the forefront and remaining the focus of his research. The newly named dean of the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology continues to untangle the complexities of bone in the Bone Biology and Mechanics Lab, carrying that same intense focus on collagen.
At Purdue University in Indianapolis, Wallace’s bone research has ventured into the role collagen in bone plays in diabetes and kidney disease. When collagen in bone is exposed to heat, it generates a reaction that stimulates advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These AGEs form as cross-links in the collagen structure, inappropriately stiffening the collagen and preventing the normal sliding and ductility of the structure, causing an embrittling effect in bone.
Wallace’s publications on artificially inducing AGEs in bone, the development of a model of diabetes and a model of combined diabetes and kidney disease laid the foundation for a recent Veterans Affairs grant. Awarded last January, that grant has placed Wallace as the principal investigator on a current study focusing on establishing diabetes and kidney disease models within the veteran population.
“Diabetes affects so many Americans,” Wallace said. “Not that other disease models aren’t important, but it’s different from some of my past research. You’re talking about something that impacts 35 to 40 million people versus 25,000 to 50,000, so I’m excited to go in that direction.”
Purdue University in Indianapolis is a new, fully integrated extension of the West Lafayette flagship campus, expanding the academic rigor and accessible excellence that Purdue is known for to Indiana’s industrial and technological center. As the only public top 10 university, most trusted university and most innovative university in the state of Indiana, Purdue is focused and committed to strengthening its presence in the capital city. Purdue University in Indianapolis will reimagine a collaborative platform that connects students, faculty and local businesses to promote breakthrough discoveries and create a new and direct talent pipeline. Realignment of the existing IUPUI partnership is expected to be completed by the start of the fall semester in 2024.

Solving stickiness sustainably,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Glue holds the world together. Without adhesives, much of modern human civilization — including our cellphones, cars, furniture, walls and the packages arriving on our doorstep — would simply fall apart.
The trouble with all those adhesives is that they are not sustainable. A team of chemists at Purdue University led by Jonathan Wilker, professor of chemistry in the College of Science and of materials engineering, aims to change that with a new, completely sustainable adhesive system. The team’s findings were released in a paper in Nature.
Shellfish inspire chemists to develop new, stronger, more sustainable glues
Environmentally sustainable commercial adhesive from Purdue is optioned to gluECO Adhesives
Changing seawater hints at future for adhesives from sea creatures
“Our current adhesives create all sorts of environmental problems,” Wilker said. “Almost all glues are petroleum-based and do not degrade. The bonded materials in our products stay stuck together. Consequently, we cannot recycle many of the materials that we put into our recycling bins. Discarded products will sit in landfills for centuries and, sometimes, contribute to ocean microplastics.”
Wilker and his lab have spent years studying the science of sticky substances, analyzing marine animals that adhere, like mussels and oysters, and trying to create better, sustainable, affordable adhesives that work as well as any glue from the hardware store. He has a drawer of those commercial glues in his lab, which give off a strong and familiar smell.
“Those volatile petrochemicals in these glues can be toxic, which is a further problem with current technologies,” Wilker said. One example is the common building material plywood, which is formed of wood pieces held together with formaldehyde-based adhesives. Newly built houses are off-gassing formaldehyde, exposing residents to this carcinogen.
These substances are harmful both to the environment and to human health. However, people and companies are accustomed to using traditional adhesives; they’re strong, easy to produce and relatively inexpensive. Any new adhesive must work at least as well as traditional products, which is why Wilker keeps that drawer around: to test them, side by side, against innovative substances.
“By studying how nature makes adhesives, we are learning how to design new technologies for our future society,” Wilker said. “Given all of the problems generated by current glues, we feel an obligation to create something better. Ideally, new adhesives will be bio-based and nontoxic. Strengths should be as high as current products. Then we would like to bond them strongly when needed and also be able to take the substrates apart when wanted. Further design constraints that we grapple with, in order to have impact, are costs needing to be low and having all starting compounds available at large scales.”
After a series of experiments on a range of different biologically sourced and sustainable ingredients, the team settled on epoxidized soy oil for a main component. Epoxidized soy oil is already produced globally on a massive scale. For their work, the smallest container that they could purchase was a 55-gallon drum of the substance. Since each experiment uses just a little epoxidized soy oil, the level in their drum has dropped only a few inches after several years of testing.
Wilker and his team added the epoxidized soy oil to malic acid, a compound most known for giving apples their tart flavor. Then they added tannic acid, to provide an aspect of the chemistry that mussels use for attaching themselves to rocks and each other. Tannic acid is a component of tannins, common in trees, red wine and black tea. Those three ingredients added up to an adhesive that is inexpensive, effective, scalable, practical to produce and completely sustainable.
“If you combine these components under the right conditions, adhesives can be made that are as strong as epoxies,” Wilker said. Epoxies are generally considered to be the highest performance class of adhesives. “All of the components are bio-based, safe and already available at train car scales. A bonus is that the adhesive is easy to make. Basically, you can mix and heat the components.” Other bio-based compounds can also be used with epoxidized soy oil, generating an entire family of new sustainable adhesives.
To test the adhesive’s performance, the scientists bonded together objects — wood, plastics or metals — and then used an instrument for breaking the bonds and measuring forces. In many cases, their new adhesives held up well, sometimes performing similarly to, or even better than, traditional toxic adhesives such as a superglue and an epoxy. Further research will refine the system and work to maximize societal and environmental impacts in areas ranging from medical innovations to industrial materials to packaging. Their team’s innovations may pave the way to a more sustainable system for holding the world together.
Wilker disclosed his adhesives to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent to protect the intellectual property. This research was supported by the Office of Naval Research.

"Purdue panels to address US semiconductor needs, ‘Next Big Things in Tech’ at Fast Company Innovation Festival","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Featured alongside Hilton, AT&T, Patagonia and Moderna, Purdue University will share its innovative solutions to some of the world’s toughest challenges as part of the ninth annual Fast Company Innovation Festival taking place Sept. 18-21 in New York City.
The four-day festival, attended by thousands of the world’s most inventive thinkers, up-and-coming entrepreneurs and visionaries, showcases “creativity and groundbreaking ideas that are transforming industries.” Purdue will take part in two panel discussions sharing excellence at scale in semiconductor workforce development and innovative “smart concrete” technology.
Fast Company: Purdue the ‘most innovative university in America’
Fast Company chooses Purdue University among its ‘Brands That Matter’ for second year in a row
The Sept. 20 panel “Securing the Future: Driving Innovation Through the Semiconductor Workforce” will bring together government, academia and industry as Purdue President Mung Chiang and Adrienne Elrod, director of external and government affairs in the CHIPS Program Office, take the stage to share how collaboration is elevating the semiconductor ecosystem.
“Our nation has a serious challenge ahead: a need for 50,000 trained semiconductor engineers this decade to help power our phones, cars and everyday devices, and our nation’s military and defense technologies,” Chiang said. “Through the Semiconductor Degrees Program and as part of the Purdue Computes initiative, Purdue is answering the call with unparalleled excellence at scale.”
To educate the workforce needed to produce the most sophisticated technology humans create, Purdue launched its Semiconductor Degrees Program, a suite of degrees and credentials to enable a quick ramp-up of in-demand skilled talent to reassert American preeminence in this critical industry. In April, Purdue’s Board of Trustees approved Phase 1 of a $100 million plan to upgrade semiconductor research and learning facilities and hire 50 faculty members as part of the three-pronged Purdue Computes initiative.
SkyWater plans to open a $1.8 billion state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facility in Discovery Park District at Purdue, the bookend forming America’s Hard Tech Corridor. Recently called “Indiana’s chip-making metamorphosis” by The New York Times, the 65-mile corridor between Purdue’s flagship West Lafayette campus and Purdue University in Indianapolis, Purdue’s new urban campus, will become the most consequential engine of economic growth and brain gain in the Midwest as it continues to generate workforce, jobs and innovation.
During another panel on Sept. 21, Luna Lu, associate dean and the Reilly Professor in the Lyles School of Civil Engineering, will share how her “smart concrete,” named a Fast Company Next Big Things in Tech, is cutting down construction time and saving taxpayers millions of dollars. Lu’s innovative sensors, which allow concrete to “communicate” with engineers about its strength, have already been embedded in highways in at least eight states, including at the future I-465 interchange to I-69 south on Indianapolis’ south side.
“Traffic jams caused by infrastructure repairs have wasted 4 billion hours and 3 billion gallons of gas on a yearly basis,” Lu said. “This technology cuts down on construction, is better for the environment and is able to adapt to future needs as vehicles continue to evolve.”
Earlier this year, Fast Company editors ranked Purdue No. 16 among the World’s Most Innovative Companies and No. 1 in education, citing the university’s mission to solve the nationwide shortage of semiconductor engineers. Purdue follows OpenAI (at No. 1) and leads NASA (No. 17) and The Walt Disney Co. (No. 25) as organizations “paving the way for the innovations of tomorrow” and “setting the standard with some of the greatest accomplishments of the modern world.” Purdue has also been recognized by Fast Company among its Brands That Matter for two years in a row — the only university on the list both years.

Study improves accuracy of planted forest locations in East Asia,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
An international team led by Purdue University scientists has created the first spatial database of planted forests in East Asia by combining data collected on-site and via satellite. Produced with the assistance of artificial intelligence, the database contains forest location maps at a resolution of one kilometer (six-tenths of a mile) and lists the most common tree species growing there, such as pine and eucalyptus.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that East Asia holds 36% of the world’s planted forests. Africa, meanwhile, has 19%; Europe, 7%; and the United States, 9%. Within East Asia, 87.0% of planted forest is in China, followed by 11.1% in Japan, 1.0% in South Korea and 0.9% in North Korea.
Previous maps of East Asia’s planted forests covered only parts of the region spanning China, Japan, North Korea and South Korea. And the data sources for those maps are inconsistent and unverified.
“We used an AI approach to help us understand a massive amount of data, measured both from the ground and also from remote-sensing sources,” said Jingjing Liang, associate professor of quantitative forest ecology at Purdue. “This study complements the research portfolio of the Institute for Digital Forestry with an international perspective, enriching our understanding of global forest ecosystems and their sustainable management.”
A collaboration consisting of Liang, lead author Akane Abbasi, a PhD student in forestry and natural resources, and 15 co-authors recently presented their results in the journal Scientific Data.
The project collaborators are members of Science-i and the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative (GFBI). Science-i is a web-based platform involving more than 300 scientists worldwide. GFBI has built a database of 1.3 million sample plots and 55 million trees.
“At Land & Carbon Lab, we believe what gets measured gets managed,” said study co-author Nancy Harris, research director of Land & Carbon Lab and Global Forest Watch at World Resources Institute. “Our partnership with Purdue and FAO embodies our mission to deploy breakthroughs in geospatial monitoring that power solutions for sustainable landscapes. Seeing where these different types of forests are on a map revolutionizes the options for interpretation and decision-making that go beyond simply knowing how much forest is in a country.”
Integrating the various data sources was one of the project’s big challenges. The team started with data that came in different formats, types and spatial extents.
“Some data cover only China. Some data cover only Japan. Some data cover China and South Korea,” Abbasi said. One dataset based on satellite images covered China, Japan and South Korea but not North Korea. “They differ in spatial extent. They also differ in relatability in terms of whether it’s measured on the ground or from space.”
The researchers integrated data collected on-site, by satellite and through an approach called “ensemble machine learning.” This method entailed using AI to train three different machine learning models.
“The ensemble machine learning method is developed to account for imperfections in both data and the model,” said Liang, who also is co-director of the Forest Advanced Computing and Artificial Intelligence Lab (FACAI).
The team used the Bell Community Cluster at Purdue’s Rosen Center for Advanced Computing to process and analyze the massive amount of data involved in the project.
“When I say I study forest ecology, people assume that I go to the forest, measure something, then come back and analyze the data,” Abbasi said. “But this is not what we’re doing here. We deal with very large spatial extents, and we study nature using cutting-edge AI and machine learning.”
Scientists know from official, country-led estimates that East Asia by far contains the world’s largest proportion of planted forest, said study co-author Javier Gamarra of FAO. “Yet most of the region has traditionally tended to be less prone to follow open data policies about forest information, which makes the exercise of estimating such area particularly challenging,” he said.
The results confirm previous data shown by the FAO’s Global Forest Resource Assessment (FRA). “But in this case, we can obtain spatial locations of where forest plantations exist at small resolutions, something that FRA cannot show,” Gamarra said.
Gamarra lauded Purdue’s use of AI to combine data collected both via satellites and on the ground to produce robust estimates that could prove especially useful in making vast amounts of forest resource information widely available.
“In fact, FAO’s Forestry Division is actively collaborating with Professor Liang’s FACAI Lab and the World Resources Institute to expand the use of artificial intelligence to obtain ecozone-based estimates of forest growth across the globe,” he said.
China has planted more forest in recent decades than any other nation, covering an area of more than 324,000 square miles. That area is greater than the square mileage of the states of Texas and New York combined. Japan and South Korea, meanwhile, planted many of their forests 50 or 60 years ago.
After World War II and the Korean War, demand was high for forest products, so people started planting forest plots. “That was a huge contribution to most of the planted forests in those countries,” Abbasi said.
Sandstorms regularly pelt Beijing, which stands less than 60 miles from the nearest desert. This has led the Chinese government to begin planting trees on sand dunes, a costly and labor-intensive process.
“Learning from what China did would be one thing we can do to help the world plant more trees to stem deforestation,” Liang said.
The co-authors include Purdue’s Ankita Mitra, a PhD student in forestry and natural resources; and Mohammad Jahanshahi, associate professor in the Lyles School of Civil Engineering.

Purdue recognized as national innovation leader: 4th among US universities in US patents received,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A national organization dedicated to inventors at academic institutions has recognized Purdue University’s innovation culture and technology transfer resources as among the best in the nation.
In the 2022 calendar year, Purdue Research Foundation received 192 patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), placing Purdue fourth among all U.S. universities. The information was published in a report Tuesday (Sept. 12) from the National Academy of Inventors. The top three were the University of California system, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Texas system.
Purdue Research Foundation manages the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which operates the technology transfer process. OTC vets invention disclosures from university personnel, applies for patents and other intellectual property protections, and licenses innovations to established and startup companies worldwide. OTC’s technology portfolio covers innovations in agriculture, computer technology, engineering, medical/health, pharmaceuticals, veterinary medicine and more subject areas.
Purdue University President Mung Chiang said the NAI ranking strengthens the university’s national reputation in several ways.
“First, the ranking proves that the university’s researchers are making discoveries along a wide breadth of subjects from energy and manufacturing to medical devices and pharmaceuticals and beyond,” Chiang said. “Second, the USPTO issues patents only on innovations that are novel and useful. Purdue researchers are making discoveries that have not been seen before and serve a purpose to benefit people’s lives. Third, the ranking proves that Purdue has developed a culture where discovery is the first step, not the final destination. Industry partners and entrepreneurs are aware of Purdue resources to bring innovations to the marketplace.”
Brian Edelman, president of Purdue Research Foundation, said Purdue Innovates provides a turnkey solution for Purdue University researchers with an interest in entrepreneurship.
“Purdue Innovates makes sure innovations from the laboratory reach the public,” Edelman said. “We provide dedicated services from protecting and licensing innovations to launching companies that bring university intellectual property to the market. These services include coaching innovators with plans for a startup and networking connections between company founders and respected Purdue businesspeople, investors and entrepreneurs to help the Purdue-connected startups obtain the talent and capital to grow at scale.”
Brooke Beier, senior vice president of Purdue Innovates, said the high level of technology transfer achievement is attributable to the excellence of two groups.
“First are the dedicated Purdue researchers who disclose innovations to the Office of Technology Commercialization and work closely with the OTC team through the entire patenting process. Their brilliant discoveries are at the core of the technology transfer pipeline,” Beier said. “Second are the dedicated professionals at OTC who vet, protect and license Purdue’s intellectual property. They shepherd the discoveries through the pipeline with their subject-matter expertise, legal acumen and business insight.”
In the 2022 fiscal year, the Office of Technology Commercialization:
Received 379 total disclosures from Purdue innovators: 361 invention disclosures and 18 copyright disclosures.
Filed 699 patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and international patent organizations.
Received 239 U.S. and international patents.
Executed 157 licenses and options.
Received $6.77 million worth of gross revenue in royalty and licensing income ($4.26 million net).
Helped establish nine startup companies.
The Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization operates one of the most comprehensive technology transfer programs among leading research universities in the U.S. Services provided by this office support the economic development initiatives of Purdue University and benefit the university’s academic activities through commercializing, licensing and protecting Purdue intellectual property. In fiscal year 2022, the office reported 157 deals finalized with 237 technologies signed, 379 disclosures received and 169 issued U.S. patents. The office is managed by the Purdue Research Foundation, which received the 2019 Innovation and Economic Prosperity Universities Award for Place from the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. In 2020, IPWatchdog Institute ranked Purdue third nationally in startup creation and in the top 20 for patents.

Purdue honors contributions of forestry and natural resources professionals and academics,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue Department of Forestry and Natural Resources honored five individuals for their career achievements at an awards ceremony held at Purdue University on Sept. 8.
David Case (BS forestry ’80) received the department’s Lifetime Achievement Award, Trent Osmon (BS forestry ’99) was named the FNR Distinguished Alumnus, and Adam Janke (BS wildlife ’09) was selected as the FNR Outstanding Young Alumnus for 2023.
John “Jack” Seifert was honored with the Chase S. Osborn Award in Wildlife Conservation, and Emily McCallen (PhD ’18) received the Chase S. Osborn Early Career Award.
David Case made his impact on the natural resources field as the founder, president and owner of D.J. Case & Associates. The private communications and public relations firm helps agencies and organizations distill complex issues and technical research findings into language that is easily understood by the public, better informing them about critically important conservation issues. Over the last 37 years, Case and his staff have worked on projects ranging from a Yup’ik Eskimo education program assessment in Alaska to key deer in the Florida Keys.
“The place where you have the most impact potential is at the spearpoint where the tough decisions are being made or people are being persuaded or not by how effective you are. At D.J. Case & Associates, we’ve been fortunate to be involved in projects that have some aspect like that. I would never have been in those positions if it weren’t for the building blocks that were laid at Purdue,” Case said.
Trent Osmon got a head start toward his career as part of the co-op program, which allowed students to alternate semesters between the field and classroom. Osmon worked 40 hours a week in the public works division at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, in southern Indiana for three years. There he received hands-on training in forest management and environmental assessments before earning his bachelor’s degree in forestry in 1999. After graduation, the Odon native accepted a full-time position as a forester at Crane, a position he held until 2010, when he was promoted to forestry program team lead. Osmon is now the environmental division supervisor on the naval installation, overseeing environmental compliance programs and cultural resources management.
“I always knew I wanted to work outdoors, but Purdue FNR was where I realized who I was,” Osmon said. “Purdue holds an extremely special place in my heart and is one of the most important pieces of my life in terms of education and experience, and it got me where I’m at now.”
Adam Janke, a Monticello native who earned his bachelor’s degree in wildlife from Purdue in 2009, gained hands-on career experience through summer undergraduate positions. He worked as an intern biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a wildlife technician with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and a research technician for both the Delta Waterfowl Foundation and the Purdue Department of Forestry and Natural Resources. In 2011, he earned a master’s degree in fisheries and wildlife at Ohio State University, and in 2016 he completed a PhD at South Dakota State University. Janke then accepted his current position on the faculty at Iowa State University. Over the last seven years, he has studied wetland birds, songbirds and game birds, and applied findings of his research to aid the conservation and preservation of wildlife across agricultural landscapes.
“I wanted to be a wildlife biologist even before I knew I could do it professionally,” Janke said. “When I found out there was a major at Purdue, I knew I wanted to study wildlife at Purdue, and the rest is history. Wildlife biology is a really accessible form of science. You don’t need a fancy analytical machine in a lab — you just need a pair of binoculars and patience.”
John “Jack” R. Seifert, a St. Louis native, has contributed to wildlife conservation in Indiana throughout his 45-year career in forestry. Seifert was hired as an Extension forester in the Purdue Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at the Southeast Purdue Agricultural Center. In that role, he educated and promoted professional forest management to landowners and provided professional education to foresters for 27 years. Seifert later accepted his current position as the Indiana state forester and the director of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources Division of Forestry. He has been vital in supporting the Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment in Morgan-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests, a research study conducted by Purdue and other universities, which evaluates the responses of plants and animals to forest management treatments. “I started my conservation career when I was very young, and hunting was near and dear to my life,” Seifert said. “As I look back on my time at Purdue, it was the best experience I could have ever had. Purdue presented the ability to grow professionally and to educate those willing to be educated in natural resource science, which was a pretty rewarding experience.”
Emily McCallen took an untraditional path to her career in natural resources. After a year in liberal arts college, she took time off to reassess her goals and work. She returned, took her first biology class and was hooked. In 2018, McCallen completed a PhD in forestry and natural resources at Purdue, researching the state-endangered eastern hellbender salamander. That same year, she was hired as a wildlife biometrician for the Indiana Department of Natural Resources Division of Fish & Wildlife. Over the last five years, she has collaborated with biologists and wildlife managers to turn data and statistics into applied science and find unique ways to present that information to the public.
“My time at Purdue was amazing,” McCallen said. “I got to work with a lot of people while I was there as a grad student, and I feel really lucky that I get to work with those people now here in my capacity as a biometrician. At the DNR, we have an awesome collaborative environment with great people who are always pushing each other to improve. To have the work that I’m doing here in Indiana acknowledged and honored by the same people I worked with in FNR feels like a huge honor and a bit overwhelming, but I am so grateful.”

Virtual Road to Retirement event slated for Sept. 26-29 for all benefits-eligible employees,"summarize:All benefits-eligible employees are invited to take part in the upcoming virtual Road to Retirement event, which aims to help individuals navigate a lifelong road to retirement.
Scheduled for Sept. 26-29, the event is designed to meet employees where they are on the retirement planning path and offers resources for all stages of retirement planning — from early career to advanced — regardless of life or career stage. It’s never too early or too late to build the foundation for a fulfilling, financially secure future.
The Road to Retirement fall conference is offered virtually to accommodate various work schedules and allow employees to attend the sessions that are of most interest. Best of all, many of the sessions are available afterward so individuals can revisit any or watch one they might have missed.
Whatever stage in life an individual finds themselves, Fidelity — Purdue’s official provider of education, guidance and assistance related to retirement plan investments and decisions — along with the other Road to Retirement presenters, will share a variety of helpful information to assist individuals on their retirement journey. As Road to Retirement approaches, there are some resources that might be helpful based on where an individual currently is in regard to retirement. They are outlined below:
Retirement may be far off, but the sooner someone begins, the less stressful saving for it will be. There are good practices to put in place early to make it easier to build the retirement nest egg that’s wanted.
Consider watching “Managing My Money” or “Identify and Prioritize Your Savings Goals.”
Most people will have to adapt their retirement plan from time to time when life
happens. The important thing is to manage through those events to get your retirement plan back on track.
Consider watching “Manage Unexpected Events and Expenses.”
Some individuals are in the home stretch. They’ve been saving, and now they’re about to see all their planning come to fruition. As they inch closer, they’ll need to start making decisions on income and health care.

The world’s smallest drum,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Boilermakers everywhere already know that Purdue is home of the World’s Largest Drum.
But have you heard about the world’s smallest drum? It’s probably not going to get rolled out onto the field at Ross-Ade Stadium for any football games. Even if it were, you wouldn’t be able to see it.
That’s because small means small — about the width of a human hair.
David Cappelleri, professor of mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering (by courtesy), came up with the idea for the world’s smallest drum to test out the Nanoscribe Photonic Professional GT2 3D printer, which streamlines the production of microscopic materials while pioneering new potential applications in medical treatments. Housed at Birck Nanotechnology Center in Discovery Park District at Purdue, the printer is the first of its kind in operation in Indiana and was acquired with a financial award from the U.S. National Science Foundation.
The printer is revolutionizing how Purdue microrobotics researchers engage with the field and vastly expanding the potential benefits of mobile microrobots.

Important building block to brand success includes workforce buy-in,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
From Amazon and Band-Aid to Verizon and Ziploc, companies spend vast amounts of money, time and effort to promote their brands to customers. But how important is it for brand loyalty to carry over to the company’s workforce, especially in the service delivery sectors? Ceridwyn King, who was named head of White Lodging-J.W. Marriott, Jr. School of Hospitality and Tourism Management at Purdue University in July 2022, says getting internal stakeholders — employees — to champion the brand is key.
“Significant investment in your brand may be futile if consideration is not given to the thoughts and actions of the individuals responsible for bringing the brand to life,” said King, whose research focuses on brand management. “If your own workforce doesn’t understand or buy in to the company brand, why would the customers?”
Ranked No. 1, Purdue’s 100% online hospitality and tourism management master’s is a hot commodity
White Lodging and Purdue University enhance relationship, honor J.W. ‘Bill’ Marriott, Jr.
King said in a competitive business environment, such as hospitality, differentiation of services and the customer experience often depend on employees’ ability to deliver on the brand’s promise.
“Our industry is very labor-intensive,” she said. “How can we provide these exceptional experiences which require the human element and creativity?”
The answer, she said, is embracing the use of innovative technologies at hotels, restaurants and other entertainment venues. King said that’s an important lesson for hospitality and tourism management (HTM) classrooms.
“Part of our vision is to provide our students with all of the tools that help them be ‘experience engineers,’ that help them to amplify that human element and rid themselves of things that automation or technology can help them do,” King said.
King brings decades of industry expertise to Marriott Hall. The Australian native grew up along the country’s Gold Coast, a major tourist destination known for sand, sun and surf. She served as head of marketing for Conrad Jupiters Hotel and Casino, a 609-room entertainment venue in Australia that boasted 2,500 employees. King also founded her own marketing company.
After spending the early part of her career in industry, King then moved into academia.
In 2011, she joined Temple University in Philadelphia, where she served as a professor in the School of Sport, Tourism and Hospitality Management and as director of strategic industry engagement for the Fox School of Business Translational Research Center.
“I’ve been so fortunate to both work in industry and also have an opportunity to make a difference in students’ lives by helping them discover a passion for the business,” she said.
King was first attracted to Purdue by its highly vaunted and nationally ranked hospitality and tourism management program. But she saw something else during the interview process.
“It was the consistency in both the acknowledgment of needing to evolve and a willingness to evolve the program. I felt it along every step of the way of my interview process,” King said. “I really felt that played to my strengths.”
That evolution, said King, will rely on the adoption of innovation and cutting-edge technologies to improve the student experience and postgraduation career preparation.
Marion Underwood, dean of the College of Health and Human Sciences, describes King as a strategic, forward-thinking leader poised to drive transformative change in HTM.
“She possesses a global understanding of higher education, extensive knowledge of the hospitality industry, and high-level awareness of marketing and communication strategies. Harnessing the synergies of HTM and its Division of Consumer Science and building partnerships throughout the university, Dr. King is an exemplary driver of innovation and continues to strengthen HTM’s global reputation,” Underwood said.
King said when she meets new Purdue colleagues from other disciplines, she discovers others who see the potential for crossover collaboration. As Purdue competes against other national programs in attracting the best HTM students, she said integration of innovative curriculum will help set Purdue apart.
“Purdue has such a wonderful reputation in things like industrial engineering, AI, data analytics, food science and nutrition, but no HTM programs are integrating them in an educational experience. Yet this is exactly how the industry is operating,” King said. “If anyone is going to own the word ‘innovation’ in a hospitality and tourism context, who else but Purdue?”
King joined Purdue as the HTM industry was still recovering from the global pandemic. She said the impact of COVID-19 amplified the need for change in the hospitality industry, forcing it to adapt and evolve. Likewise, King says, academia needs to constantly reengineer itself.
King said Purdue HTM is known for training its students for operational excellence, but “what operational excellence is today is very different from what it was 20 years ago,” she added.
In August 2020, Purdue ushered in a new era in hospitality at Purdue with the reopening of the historic Union Club Hotel, following completion of a $35 million renovation. HTM students can earn practical experience at the on-campus venue. Likewise, King says she is constantly evaluating the HTM space at Marriott Hall, looking for opportunities for improvement and growth for students.
“If the industry wants exceptional talent, then there needs to be that investment. We want to elevate and inspire the future generation and provide them an environment that inspires creativity and innovation,” King said. “As we move forward, I’m looking to try and create more of this interdisciplinary experience. That really means that our students are at the forefront of being industry change-makers.”

A New Era in Comparative Medical Research and Opportunities to Position Purdue as a World Leader
Distinguished Professor of Comparative Oncology, the Dolores L. McCall Professor of Comparative Oncology and director of the Evan and Sue Ann Werling Comparative Oncology Research Center
Abstract. This presentation will center on comparative oncology research in which studies of specific forms of naturally occurring cancer in pet dogs are designed to ultimately improve the outlook for humans, as well as pet dogs facing cancer. A brief overview of the field and its critical importance will be given. The presentation will also touch on four areas:
Challenges including the high failure rate of new cancer drugs in human clinical trials and the reasons for these failures, and challenges in aligning veterinary researchers to respond to new opportunities in comparative medical research.
The incredible opportunities that have emerged in the last five years, including growing buy-in for the value of canine studies in comparative cancer research, and unprecedented increases in funding for canine research.
The reasons why Purdue can be well positioned as a world leader in this field.
A suggested roadmap forward.

New bio-based glues from Purdue form adhesive bonds that grow stronger in water,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Patent-pending adhesive formulations developed at Purdue University from fully sustainable, bio-based components establish bonds that grow stronger when underwater or exposed to wet conditions.
Gudrun Schmidt, an associate professor of practice in Purdue’s Department of Chemistry, and a team of researchers developed the formulations from zein, a protein found in corn, and tannic acid. A paper about the team’s research was published in the peer-reviewed journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.
The adhesive formulations could be further developed and used in the restoration of coral reefs and have applications in the construction, manufacturing, biomedical, dental, food and cosmetic industries.
Schmidt and her colleagues conducted underwater adhesive experiments on their formulations, using different surfaces and different waters, including seawater, saline solution, tap water and deionized water.
“Interestingly, the water type does not influence performance a great deal, but the substrate type does,” Schmidt said. “An additional unexpected result was bond strengths increasing over time when exposed to water, contradicting general experiments of working with traditional, petroleum-based glues. Initial adhesion underwater was stronger compared to benchtop adhesion, suggesting that water helps to make the glue stick underwater.”
Protective skin formed on the surface of the adhesives when placed underwater, which kept water from entering the rest of the material immediately.
“But once the skin was in place, it could be broken to induce faster bond formation,” Schmidt said.
The experiments also indicated maximum bonding at about 30 degrees Celsius, then another increase at higher temperatures.
Schmidt said the process to make the adhesive formulations is a short one.
“We can use inexpensive, sustainably sourced, plant-based materials to make gallons of glue within hours,” Schmidt said. “The adhesives are very simple to make in the lab or outdoors, everywhere on the planet.”
Schmidt said other researchers are formulating adhesives that mimic the glues used by mussels, barnacles, oysters and sandcastle worms to adhere to the seafloor and other wet surfaces. Those best-performing formulations, however, are fully synthetic.
“Lengthy syntheses with the use of harsh chemicals may hold back their future development,” Schmidt said. “Nontoxicity, sustainably sourced materials and minimal environmental impact are increasingly in demand. Consequently, several groups have turned to developing new and remaking old adhesive systems using bioinspired or bio-based chemistry.”
The increased demand of nontoxic materials has led to creating adhesives for biomedical applications. The resulting glues have properties similar to soft tissue. Schmidt said that bio-based adhesives have further applications.
“Once the in vivo and biomedical realm is left behind, there is an entire world of other applications requiring metals, plastics, wood and inorganic substrates that need adhesives to work in the presence of water,” Schmidt said. “Food, oral and cosmetic applications are less restrictive when it comes to purity of starting materials. Food-grade polymers can often be used for making wet adhesives. We also are working on dental applications, trying to make bonds in this wet and challenging environment.”
Schmidt said another particularly intriguing application for the patent-pending Purdue-developed adhesive formulations is the restoration of coral reefs.
“There are several major efforts, worldwide, planting young corals to replace those structures that are already dead,” Schmidt said. “A major hindrance to these efforts is lack of suitable underwater adhesives that work well for this application.”
Schmidt and her research team are working with the Coral Restoration Foundation, sending various formulations to be tested.
“We recently visited the Florida Keys to test a few formulations in bucketsful of ocean water,” Schmidt said. “It is great to see our work outside of the research lab and in the real, wet world.”
The Coral Restoration Foundation constantly searches for the most efficient and effective method of outplanting coral onto reef sites, said Phanor H. Montoya-Maya, coral restoration program manager at CRF.
“Having different alternatives means different species and habitats can be outplanted with positive results,” Montoya-Maya said. “Science collaborations like this allow us to test and fine-tune methods before mainstream restoration. Field preliminary results are very encouraging, and we’ll continue to provide feedback to Purdue researchers to ensure the final product is consistently successful across multiple restoration goals.”
Schmidt disclosed the adhesive formulations to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent to protect the intellectual property.

Campuswide PurdueALERT test scheduled for Sept. 28,"summarize:Purdue University will test its PurdueALERT emergency notification system at 10 a.m. on Thursday, Sept. 28. The test will include the activation of the outdoor all-hazards sirens.
The test will help the campus community know what the sirens sound like and what to do during a potential emergency. Jefferson Howells, director of Emergency Preparedness and Planning, says the university’s emergency plan should be easy for the campus community to understand and follow.
“It’s simple — if you are outside and hear a siren, go inside the nearest building,” Howells said. “If you are inside and hear a fire alarm, go outside.”
While the Sept. 28 test requires no action, Howells said it should serve as a reminder to review Building Emergency Plans and the Emergency Procedures Guide.
Howells said the U.S. Department of Education requires one such test each year. Purdue typically tests the PurdueALERT system during both the fall and spring semesters.
As part of the test, other notifications also will be sent through text messages, Twitter/X (@purdueemergency), digital signs on campus, desktop popup alerts, Alertus beacons in classrooms, email and Boiler TV.
In the event of an actual emergency, the Campus Emergency Status webpage will also be updated. All incoming students and others who are new to campus are encouraged to sign up for emergency text message notifications.
The test is weather dependent, and, if needed, will be rescheduled for Friday, Sept. 29.
Emergency Preparedness and Planning is part of the Administrative Operations organization. The organization supports the university by providing safe, reliable and transformative services. Making sure the campus community is aware of the emergency notification system and knows how to respond in the event of an actual emergency is just one of the ways the organization helps power Purdue.

"Purdue delegation embarks on USS Nimitz, gains insights into naval operations","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
It was the experience of a lifetime for members of a Purdue University delegation as they cruised the Pacific Ocean on the USS Nimitz with almost 5,000 sailors.
Frank Dooley, chancellor of Purdue Global; Dimitrios Peroulis, senior vice president for Purdue University Online; and Kelvin Gumbs, executive director for educational partnerships in Purdue’s Office of Industry Partnerships, participated in this firsthand experience, which offered a unique view into the training-rich environment of sailors at sea, learning about ways to strengthen educational opportunities for officers and enlisted personnel.

“It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Dooley said of his weekend at sea. Approximately 300 dignitaries a year visit the Nimitz (CVN 68), a supercarrier and the lead ship of the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz class of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
The trio started their visit receiving briefs at the Naval Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet headquarters and then took off from Naval Air Station North Island in Coronado, California, on a C-2 Greyhound aircraft, which made an arrested landing on the Nimitz.
“The arrested landing forces the aircraft to stop completely within a second or two. The deceleration that you feel is immense — going from 160 miles per hour to zero,” Peroulis said. “By the time you realize what is going on, it has ended. It’s only a few hundred feet and the plane has stopped.”
Once on board, the Purdue delegation began meeting with the admiral, commanding officer, executive officer, command master chief, and other officers and enlisted personnel, touring most areas of the ship.
A highlight of the Purdue delegation was watching the crew perform about 180 daytime and nighttime flight maneuvers, in some instances observing from just 30 feet away as F/A-18 Super Hornets launched from the flight deck.
“All of these men and women serving on the USS Nimitz have received training and are constantly training,” Dooley said. “It is incredible, and it shows how the team all knows how to work together in their areas. Everyone knows what they are supposed to do. It’s a well-organized and -operating machine.”
Purdue Global serves approximately 10,000 military-affiliated students, a population that includes uniformed personnel, veterans and eligible dependents. Purdue University Online serves about 200 military-affiliated students through its online master’s programs.
As the trio toured the ship, they were continually greeted with “Boiler Up!”
“There were people who shared stories of relatives and friends who had come to Purdue; some people had themselves been to Purdue. There was a Purdue connection almost everywhere, which was impressive,” Peroulis said.
Dooley, Peroulis and Gumbs learned of the need for continuing education for sailors of all ranks, especially after their time in the service, and saw firsthand not only where they work but also where they live and would study. The group plans to further develop programs and procedures to make online learning programs more innovative for Navy and other armed forces personnel and more aligned with sailors’ professional development needs.
“The fact that we can serve both officers and enlisted personnel at the same time through the virtual campuses of Purdue was intriguing to them, as they are aware of Purdue’s quality education and commitment to the military. This is where Purdue is positioned so differently than other schools,” Dooley said.
Gumbs, himself a Purdue Global grad and a Navy veteran who previously served on the Nimitz, said the visit allowed everyone to understand and witness the training and learning that takes place on board.
“America’s Navy provides a tremendous opportunity for young people to receive highly technical training and learn countless skills, develop themselves as leaders, thinkers, communicators and innovators, all things that also translate smoothly into success as adult learners and our military students,” Gumbs said.
The visit also renewed a commitment to improve access to the various programs offered through Purdue Global and Purdue University Online.
“I appreciate the dedication, professionalism and skill that the Navy has. You really get to understand how much they sacrifice to accomplish their missions,” Peroulis said. “We want to further improve the quality of the opportunities we offer those crew members in their next career steps.
“Getting to know the people behind that and understanding the challenges they face, the sacrifices they make and the dedication to our country really increased my appreciation for them and my desire to serve them as best we can,” Peroulis said.

Purdue establishes permanent presence next to NSWC Crane for future of national defense and semiconductors,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Officials of Purdue University, the Purdue Applied Research Institute (PARI) and the Purdue Research Foundation announced a permanent presence in elevating the partnership with Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), in a ceremony Tuesday, Sept. 5, at WestGate Academy in Odon, Indiana. This investment will catalyze and accelerate the existing collaborative research agreements that focus on national security and defense and on semiconductors.
Titled Purdue@Crane, this focus on hypersonics, energetic materials and trusted microelectronics at WestGate@Crane Technology Park builds on the strong Crane-Purdue partnerships in these fields and takes them to the next level, Purdue officials said. This new initiative bolsters the partnership with a permanent Boilermaker presence at the Odon, Indiana, center adjacent to NSWC Crane.
“Today marks a momentous milestone and turns a new chapter in the collaboration between Purdue and Crane,” said Purdue University President Mung Chiang. “This new strategic partnership with the most important defense presence in our state brings excellence at scale to deliver solutions for national security research. With one of the nation’s largest and highly ranked STEM programs, Purdue is excited to become a permanent neighbor and dedicated partner with NSWC Crane. As America’s leading university in semiconductor workforce and innovation, we are also looking forward to the new semiconductor ecosystem at WestGate Foundry 1.”
An initial focus of this initiative — secure and reliable microelectronics — will be led by a research director, an experienced and respected leader in defense microelectronics who will expand workforce and technology development in advanced packaging, reliable and trusted microelectronics, and electronic system design.
Collaborative work with companies located in the WestGate@Crane Technology Park, beginning with NHanced Semiconductors Inc. and Everspin Technologies Inc., is anticipated. The estimated annual budget will begin at $2 million this fiscal year and is expected to grow to $40 million of collaborative research in national security by 2030, Purdue officials said.
The Purdue director and a team of researchers and staff will be located permanently outside NSWC Crane, starting at WestGate Academy. The staff will grow in number as Purdue@Crane moves forward. Plans include 3,000 square feet of space in WestGate Academy to start with, as well as a cleanroom space in WestGate Foundry 1. The cleanroom space is a forthcoming microelectronics manufacturing facility and a key component of Purdue’s semiconductors workforce, innovation and partnership strategies in the execution of the CHIPS and Science Act. The SCALE microelectronics workforce development program, which is administered by NSWC Crane, just received $19 million from the Defense Department.
Officials of NSWC Crane and Purdue joined together to make the announcement at the southern Indiana defense outpost. Among the guests were NSWC Crane Cmdr. Navy Capt. Rex Boonyobhas and U.S. Rep. Jim Baird, IN-4, who said collaborations such as this between Purdue and NSWC Crane are important.
“This kind of thing with Purdue, with the (Purdue Applied) Research Institute …  all of that ties with America and the importance of protecting this country,” Baird said.
Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb congratulated both parties on this new endeavor, noting, “Indiana’s commitment to developing the next-level, hard-tech ecosystem is ahead of schedule because of partners like Purdue University and NSWC Crane, WestGate.
“Having this formalized strategic collaboration in place will not only assist in strengthening America’s national security but also provide the academic talent pipelines necessary for next-generation innovation. I applaud President Mung Chiang and the base leadership for formalizing this important and impactful partnership.”
U.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called Purdue and NSWC Crane “two of our country’s most important assets as we strive for technological advantage.”
“Our national security depends on partnerships among higher education, the private sector and all layers of government,” Young said, “and this venture yet another example of how Indiana is leading the way.”
NHanced President Robert Patti echoed the governor’s statement. “We at NHanced are thrilled with the Purdue announcement,” he said. “Their permanent presence will accelerate our collaborations and bring new technology to market much faster.”
“As a leader in MRAM (magnetoresistive random-access memory) commercialization, research and development, and manufacturing, Everspin is excited to collaborate with Purdue University on the next generation of MRAM use cases related to artificial intelligence and high-density memory applications,” said Sanjeev Aggarwal, Everspin president and CEO.
NSWC Crane’s skilled professionals put technical solutions directly into the hands of the armed services, ensuring safer missions by leveraging the talent, knowledge and experience of its highly technical workforce.
It is this work at Crane that makes Purdue@Crane a “very natural fit” with PARI’s mission of “applying the vast research infrastructure of one of the world’s greatest universities to solving critical problems in national defense and global security,” said Mark Lewis, PARI president and CEO and a former deputy undersecretary of defense for research and engineering.
“There is a lot of discussion in defense circles about bridging the so-called ‘valley of death’ between the laboratory and the warfighter,” Lewis said, “but that is exactly what we will be doing with this new initiative. I look forward to a future of impactful collaborations at Crane.”
“NSWC Crane’s partnership with Purdue University is stronger than ever, and the strategic investment in Purdue@Crane is a true testament that our priorities are aligned to provide critical defense solutions to solve some of the nation’s toughest technical challenges,” said Angela Lewis, NSWC Crane’s technical director. “It is an honor to collaborate with an esteemed academic institution like Purdue, and I am excited to see this investment mature, particularly in the fields of hypersonics and microelectronics development.”
Purdue’s engagement at WestGate started in 2015 to support research and development of innovations through commercialization and collaboration, said Chad Pittman, chief executive of economic development at the Purdue Research Foundation. “This announcement reflects the next phase of Purdue’s commitment to the region, to NSWC Crane, to the state and to the growth of semiconductor and microelectronics workforce that is mission critical to our nation,” he said. “This announcement is an intentional next step for Purdue’s collaboration with key partners in the national defense community.”

"Public safety, health and well-being for students, staff and faculty","summarize:Dear Purdue students, faculty and staff colleagues,
Coming off the Labor Day holiday weekend, we want to share some reminders about physical safety, health and well-being and what we can do together to make this a successful semester. For all of us.
The reminders in this message are lengthy, but they are substantive and important. With our bustling Purdue community of students, faculty and staff now exceeding a population of 60,000, the more informed we are, the more prepared we can be to make the right decisions for the benefit and well-being of our fellow students and colleagues.
For our community of students, faculty and staff that’s larger than many Indiana cities, we have seen since Boiler Gold Rush how busy campus can be. That’s been made even more pleasant with the beautiful late-summer days we’ve enjoyed since the start of the semester.
With the mix of pedestrians, bicycles, skateboards, and motorized and manual scooters, be vigilant in your campus comings and goings. Purdue police remind our students, faculty, staff and visitors to put safety first while navigating our busy streets, sidewalks and bicycle paths, asking everyone to play their part by simply paying attention to their surroundings. Additional information about pedestrian safety is available on the  Transportation Services website.
As we prepared for this semester, we worked with the city of West Lafayette to reduce the speed limits for roads and streets on and around campus. Lower vehicle speeds lead to safer pedestrian movement, especially on a large college campus like Purdue.
Students, faculty and staff in need of an escort to and from campus buildings for safety purposes also can utilize the Safe Walk Program 24 hours a day by calling 765-494-SAFE (7233).
Additional safeguards are nearly 300 Emergency Telephone System (ETS) boxes at almost every street intersection and other strategic locations on campus. The ETS boxes are yellow or black, have a blue light on top and are marked “EMERGENCY” or “911.”
We provided information for our campus community during the first week of classes, highlighting what we prepare for in case of an emergency and what a potential response might look like. Our comprehensive Emergency Procedures Guide has additional information for our response to a variety of scenarios.
A full list of resources available for addressing the health and well-being needs of all our students, staff and faculty is available below at the end of the message. These are in addition to your personal networks — those friends, family, advisors, coaches, supervisors, past teachers, clergy, mentors and others that you turn to when life’s challenges arise.
As we were recently reminded by our Big Ten peers, the Purdue community is not immune to either physical safety threats or potential cyberattack on our university information technology and network systems.
For the security of our systems, we have protective measures in place and communications procedures that can be pushed out through our social media channels in the event of a malicious cyberattack aimed at Purdue.
In an extreme situation, the Purdue.edu homepage will host the most vital information, and the @LifeAtPurdue Twitter/X account will provide clear and factual information. All other university-affiliated accounts will be locked down. Updates will be published every 15 minutes.
We also remind our students, faculty and staff to do your part in protecting yourselves and the information and equipment that belongs to you or to the university. Additional safety tips are designed to help thwart cybersecurity crimes.
The Action Council on Student Housing and Well-being, a universitywide initiative launched in January, has been busy working on the behalf of our students, faculty and staff to provide that environment for success. We’re listening, we’re responding and we’re making demonstrable progress with investments in Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and approval of two new residence hall constructions.
There’s a strong spirit of collaboration and open dialogue on the Action Council as we work together to support and advance a culture for you — our undergraduate, master’s, doctorate and professional students — to pursue your highest aspirations and achieve them.
With that in mind, members of the Action Council are taking significant steps on behalf of our 38,000 undergraduate students and 12,000 master’s, professional and doctorate students, whose scholarship powers our research and teaching missions.
During this past week’s meeting, the Action Council, which brings together undergraduate and graduate student group leaders, university officials, parents and faculty, pledged to:
Define the next steps related to graduate student housing.
Work across the Big Ten Academic Alliance to enhance data collection and sharing, to continually assess our competitive position on graduate student stipends.
Study and explore undergraduate hourly pay rates across the university.
Consider recommendations from student representatives on the council to add a student well-being day and list two student-run mental health action weeks (one per semester) on the academic calendar.
Explore allowing graduate students to utilize Purdue employee travel contracts and preferred rates.
Collaborate with a move by the Purdue Graduate Student Government to send a team of students through mental health first-aid training to assist others.
As part of our persistent, ongoing efforts within the Action Council, we have listened and responded to our community by expanding the resources and support systems that address your physical and mental health and well-being. As part of that effort, we established Therapy Assistance Online (TAO).
A free, confidential well-being program, TAO evolved from a commitment we made earlier this year to grow our investment in Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). Urgency and responsiveness are critical during a crisis, and TAO is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Our campuswide efforts include the self-care tools that are part of the Steps to Leaps initiative, which is designed to bolster student success by offering tools, resources and support for all aspects of your life.
Just as important, if you are sick or not feeling well, it’s OK to stay home.
As our Fall 2023 semester gains momentum, we are grateful that each of you has chosen to be here with us as a valued member of our Purdue community. We wish you all a terrific semester. One brick higher each day: Boiler Up!

"Purdue’s audiology graduate program offers interdisciplinary approach to hearing, balance disorders","summarize:About this series: This story is part of an ongoing Purdue Today series highlighting programs ranked in the Top 10 or Top 10th percentile among our peers nationally, demonstrating the university’s persistent pursuit of excellence, innovation and transformative learning.
Roughly 37.5 million adults in the United States report some trouble hearing, the National Institutes of Health says. As hearing loss becomes increasingly prevalent, the audiology graduate program in Purdue’s Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences is preparing clinicians who are ready to meet the challenge.
A four-year doctoral degree, Purdue’s clinical audiology graduate program is ranked No. 9 nationally by U.S. News and World Report and is tops among its Indiana peers, offering students a blend of academic rigor, clinical education and research opportunities.
“Consistently ranked as one of the best in the country, our Doctor of Audiology (AuD) program gives students a deep understanding of diagnostic and rehabilitative audiology to help them become leaders in the field,” says Preeti Sivasankar, SLHS professor and department head.
“Our outstanding faculty and innovative clinical and research experiences set the program apart in offering a solid foundation for our students as they provide solutions to hearing and balance conditions in a variety of clinical settings.”

Housed in the College of Health and Human Sciences, the program aligns with the college’s interdisciplinary nature by offering students opportunities to work in innovative research environments that collaborate with other campus departments as well as the university’s centers and institutes.
In addition, the program gives students opportunities to focus on areas of interest through the nine hearing and balance clinical programs within its M.D. Steer Clinics, located on campus. There, they also can help individuals in Greater Lafayette improve their hearing or balance under the direction of clinical faculty.
“Our exceptional Doctor of Audiology program is fundamental to human health and well-being, delivering the highest-quality treatments and exploring cutting-edge innovations in hearing and balance,” says Marion K. Underwood, HHS dean and distinguished professor of psychological sciences. “The excellence of our faculty and students continue to make it one of the best programs in the nation.”
Having previously completed his bachelor’s degree in speech, language, and hearing sciences at Purdue, audiology student Leroy Medrano says the opportunities he saw in the audiology program made his graduate school decision easy.
“I chose Purdue SLHS for graduate school because there is so much interdisciplinary work involved, which I gladly advocate,” he says.
As Medrano prepares to take his next giant leap as an audiologist, he is already looking ahead to the influence he can have in advancing his patients’ health and well-being.
“This area of study is important because there is a growing number of people who have some sort of hearing disorder worldwide, and with the increase in the geriatric population, they are more prone to have hearing loss,” Medrano says. “Audiologists are very important in the holistic well-being of patients, pertaining to their hearing and balance.”",[{'summary_text': 'nearly 37.5 million adults in the united states report some trouble hearing . the audiology graduate program at Purdue is tops among its Indiana peers . students can work in innovative clinical and research environments .'}]
First-in-class targeted microRNA therapy slows cancer tumor growth,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A new cancer therapy developed by Purdue University researchers attacks tumors by tricking cancer cells into absorbing a snippet of RNA that naturally blocks cell division. As reported Monday (Sept. 4) in Oncogene, tumors treated with the new therapy did not increase in size over the course of a 21-day study, while untreated tumors tripled in size over the same time period.
Cancer can begin almost anywhere in the human body. It is characterized by cells that divide uncontrollably and that may be able to ignore signals to die or stop dividing, and even evade the immune system. The therapy, tested in mouse models, combines a delivery system that targets cancer cells with a specially modified version of microRNA-34a, a molecule that acts “like the brakes on a car,” slowing or stopping cell division, said Andrea Kasinski, lead author and the William and Patty Miller Associate Professor of Biological Sciences at Purdue University.
In addition to slowing or reversing tumor growth, the targeted microRNA-34a strongly suppressed the activity of at least three genes – MET, CD44 and AXL – known to drive cancer and resistance to other cancer therapies, for at least 120 hours. The results indicate that the patent-pending therapy, the newest iteration in more than 15 years of work targeting microRNA to destroy cancer, could be effective on its own and in combination with existing drugs when used against cancers that have built drug resistance.
“When we acquired the data, I was ecstatic. I am confident that this approach is better than the current standard of treatment and that there are patients who will benefit from this,” said Kasinski, a member of the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research.
MicroRNA-34a is a short double strand of ribonucleic acid – a string of ribonucleic acids attached like the teeth of a zipper along the length of a sugar-phosphate chain. The two strings of the microRNA are unevenly zipped together, with one string acting to guide a protein complex to the worksite in the cell while the other string is destroyed.
In healthy cells, microRNA-34a is abundant, but its presence is dramatically reduced in many cancer cells.
While the idea of reintroducing microRNA-34a to cancer cells appears simple, the research team had to overcome many challenges in crafting an effective therapy. Naturally occurring RNA breaks down rapidly, so to improve the durability of the therapy, the team stabilized microRNA-34a by adding several small clusters of atoms along the length of the strand. The team modeled its modifications on an FDA-approved chemical structure that researchers at the biotechnology company Alnylam used on similar short interfering RNAs. Experiments on mouse models show the modified microRNA-34a endures for at least 120 hours after being introduced.
As a bonus, the fully modified microRNA-34a is invisible to the immune system, which would ordinarily attack double-stranded RNA introduced to the body.
To ensure the modified microRNA-34a makes it to cancer cells, the team attached the double strand to a molecule of the vitamin folate. The surfaces of all cells in our body have receptors that bind to folate and draw the vitamin into the cell, but the cells in many cancers – breast, lung, ovarian and cervical – have far more folate receptors on their cell surface than do healthy cells. The tiny microRNA-34a and folate compound penetrates the dense tissue of tumors and binds to the folate receptor on the cell surface. It is then drawn inside in a little bag of cell membrane called a vesicle. Once inside the cell, some of the microRNA-34a is able to escape the vesicle and slows cell division.
The targeted specificity of the therapy reduces the amount of the compound that must be administered to be effective, which in turn reduces potential toxicity, side effects and cost. The team can also prepare a separate version, which targets a different cell surface receptor, for prostate cancer cells, which do not produce excessive folate receptors. Kasinski and her team are confident in the value of the most recent iteration and will prepare for clinical trials.
At Purdue, Kasinski was joined in the research by Philip S. Low, Presidential Scholar for Drug Discovery, Ralph C. Corley Distinguished Professor of Chemistry, and inventor of the FDA-approved drug Cytalux; Nadia A. Lanman, a research assistant professor; Ahmed M. Abdelaal, first author and a graduate student in Kasinski’s lab; and researchers Harish Kothandaraman, Kasireddy Sudarshan, Shreyas Iyer and Ikjot S. Sohal. “A first-in-class fully modified version of miR-34a with outstanding stability, activity, and anti-tumor efficacy” was published in Oncogene with support from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense.
Kasinski disclosed the innovation to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has filed a patent application on the IP. Industry partners interested in developing or commercializing the work should contact Joe Kasper, assistant director of business development, JRKasper@prf.org.

Defense Civilian Training Corps at Purdue creates path to service,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Twenty Purdue juniors and a host of university officials met Wednesday (Aug. 30) for the start of a big endeavor with a lot of promise: The students are the first cohort of the Defense Civilian Training Corps at Purdue University’s West Lafayette campus.
DCTC is a pilot talent development program that provides its scholars with a direct pathway to civilian careers with the Defense Department. Its multidisciplinary, experiential-learning curriculum and summer internships at DOD organizations encourage scholars to develop leadership skills and a collaborative mindset, preparing them to work on diverse, innovative teams within the defense ecosystem.
And Purdue is one of just four universities selected for the project.
Dan DeLaurentis, vice president for research institutes and centers in the Discovery Park District at Purdue and the principal investigator for Purdue’s program, said the university is thrilled to be a DCTC pilot school, noting that successive Purdue presidents and university leadership have stated unequivocally that national defense is part of the land-grant mission to improve the lives of people, families and communities.
“The DCTC program is the latest and broadest example of us stepping up to the plate in workforce development,” DeLaurentis said. “We consider it an honor but also are aware of the heavy responsibility we have to ensure success of the pilot.”
Congress approved DCTC as part of the fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. DCTC comes under the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and is supported by the Acquisition Innovation Research Center. Purdue is among 28 universities collaborating with the center and among four chosen as DCTC schools. The others are North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the University of Arizona, and Virginia Tech.
“For 18 months, we all have to provide overwhelming evidence that this can and will work at scale,” DeLaurentis said.
Full tuition, career mentoring and security clearance application are among the benefits of DCTC to eligible students. When Purdue learned in May it was among the four schools chosen for the DCTC pilot, officials had to scramble to get the first cohort in place in time for the Fall 2023 semester. But they found interest was high; once the message was out about DCTC, more than 80 rising juniors applied for a spot.
Getting a security clearance motivated DCTC scholar Nicholas Canovas, currently a junior in aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue, to apply. “I already know I want to work within the government and that I want to support the warfighter. The scholarship and stipend were a huge bonus and an important part of my decision to pursue the DCTC program,” he said. “This program helps students obtain a security clearance and exposes them to the various opportunities that the DOD has to offer.”
The 20 Purdue students in the program are in majors spanning the College of Engineering, the College of Liberal Arts, Purdue Polytechnic Institute and the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business. The diverse academic makeup of the cohort is designed to mimic the multidisciplinary teams across the DOD civilian workforce and equip scholars with the skills required to make an impact within the defense acquisition space.
Retiring Air Force Col. Ken Callahan, the former commander of Purdue’s Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, is program director for Purdue’s DCTC pilot program. He will mentor these scholars, educating them on the Defense Department and its acquisitions system, developing their teamwork and leadership skills, and helping them appreciate the unique DDD culture and core values.
“This culture includes a deep sense of meaning and purpose in national defense work and a strong connection with others they work with,” Callahan said. “We use the phrase ‘culture of care’ in DCTC to describe the sense of meaning and connection we are developing among our scholars.”
That fits the ideals of DCTC scholar Jarod Liwanag perfectly. “The armed forces have not only brought my family citizenship but also gave us a means to the middle-class American life,” he said.
Coming from a family with a long history of military service — Liwanag’s grandfather served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, his father enlisted just before 9/11 happened, and he himself joined the Army after high school — he sees DCTC as a way to carry on the family legacy as well as gain career opportunities.
Liwanag has done an internship with the Army Corps of Engineers and finds the opportunity to branch out to other DOD organizations exciting, he said. He also had interned at a private-sector business and found the work he did with the Corps to be more fulfilling — more service over profit.
Liwanag was part of a dam renovation project at Brookville that protected a nearby community from flooding. “Financially, the government lost money, but this dam needed to be built to protect the people living there,” Liwanag said. “That is the kind of organization that I want to be a part of, and DCTC provides me with a path to do so.”
Liwanag likes that DCTC can let him check out other DOD segments he may have never thought about. “My future plans are still a bit muddy, but DCTC could help clear it up a little,” he said. “The people I meet through DCTC could help me in unexpected ways many years down the line.”
Applications for the next cohort will open in October. For more information, visit the Purdue DCTC website and the federal Defense Civilian Training Corps website.

Purdue Entrepreneurial Alumni Reunion connects Boilermaker entrepreneurs and campus programs,"summarize:Boilermaker entrepreneurs are invited to come home to campus this fall to join Purdue University President Mung Chiang for a weekend of special programming. The inaugural Entrepreneurial Alumni Reunion, presented in partnership with Purdue Innovates and Purdue for Life Foundation, will be held Nov. 9-11.
The Entrepreneurial Alumni Reunion is the first theme-based Boilermaker reunion, with one rotating theme each year. This year’s reunion welcomes all Boilermakers with interests in entrepreneurship to connect among themselves, explore how Purdue can help with their entrepreneurial endeavors and explore startup creation taking place at the university by faculty and students.
“Many Boilermakers are entrepreneurs among our faculty, students and vast networks of alumni, making significant and positive difference to society,” Chiang says. “With this reunion event in November, we will strengthen the ecosystem for Boilermaker entrepreneurs by broadening our outreach and creating a network of support, both among the Boilermakers themselves and with our campus.”
The reunion will provide a platform for networking, collaboration and talent resources. Participants also will get an up-close look at how Purdue Innovates, a collaboration across campus and Purdue Research Foundation, is already making an impact.
In April, PRF and the university formed Purdue Innovates, which serves as a conduit for faculty, staff, students, alumni, industry partners, and investors to bring their ideas and innovations to the marketplace. Purdue Innovates consists of two dimensions: (1) intellectual properties such as patents and (2) startup enterprise creation. Leaders from Purdue Innovates will showcase its initiatives at the Entrepreneurial Alumni Reunion and discuss how the organization is elevating excellence at scale for both inventors and entrepreneurs.
“At Purdue Innovates, we are making big investments in the future of entrepreneurship,” says Brooke Beier, senior vice president of Purdue Innovates. “We want our alumni to learn more about this vision, the exciting new opportunities within Purdue’s startup ecosystem and, most importantly, how they can partner with us.”
Purdue is ranked in the top 10 most innovative universities in the United States — a title it has maintained for five years in a row. It is also the only university ranked among Fast Company’s list of the top 50 most innovative companies. In 2022, the Purdue Research Foundation had received 192 patents — ranking Purdue as No. 5 in the world for U.S. utility patents.",[{'summary_text': 'the inaugural Entrepreneurial Alumni Reunion is the first theme-based Boilermaker reunion . participants will get an up-close look at how Purdue Innovates is already making an impact .'}]
"What to know for first home football game Sept. 2: Safety, parking, construction, travel, game day tickets","summarize:With the first Purdue home football game scheduled for Saturday (Sept. 2) against Fresno State at the newly renovated Ross-Ade Stadium, the campus community should be aware of information related to safety, parking restrictions and designated event parking, construction impacts, travel safety, game day ticket passes, and what is new for the 2023 season.
The trained professionals within the Purdue University Police, Fire, and Emergency Preparedness and Planning departments, in concert with the broader Purdue community, are hard at work every game day to provide a safe campus environment. With several thousand people attending this Saturday’s game, it is important to put safety first while navigating a busy campus. Traffic may be congested, with delays possible.
“We ask that everyone pay attention to their surroundings and remain alert as large groups of fans make their way in and out of the stadium,” said Purdue Police Chief Lesley Wiete. “We can all work together to help ensure everyone has a safe and enjoyable game day experience.”
For notifications, the Purdue Alert system encompasses everything from emails and desktop alerts to outdoor warning sirens. Please take a moment to ensure that you are signed up to receive emergency text alerts directly to your phone.
Up-to-date campus safety status is always on the Campus Safety Status page.
In an extreme situation, the Purdue,edu homepage will host the most needed information, and @LifeAtPurdue Twitter/X account will broadcast clear and factual information. All other university-affiliated accounts will be locked down. Updates will be published every 15 minutes.
Faculty and staff who will be on campus for business purposes should prepare for parking restrictions that will be in effect starting during the day on Friday (Sept. 1) and extending into Saturday (Sept. 2). These individuals are encouraged to seek alternate parking to avoid receiving citations, being towed or paying event parking rates in some locations.
The University Street and Northwestern Avenue parking garages are again designated parking locations for home football game attendees throughout the season. These garages will become event parking locations at 7 a.m. on Saturday, and no overnight parking the night before will be permitted. Vehicles that remain in either garage as of 7 a.m. on game days will be ticketed and towed at the owner’s expense.
With the exception of university “Reserve” permit holders, anyone entering the Northwestern Avenue and University Street garages on home game days — including those who have an “A” or “Student Garage” permit — will be required to pay event parking rates or provide a prepaid, digital athletic event parking permit to gain access.

Purdue Global’s ‘This Is My Comeback’ campaign to make splash at Adweek’s Brandweek in Miami,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue Global will join elite brands such as Snapchat, Google, Meta and others during Adweek’s Brandweek, scheduled for Sept. 11-14 in Miami.
As a Gold sponsor for Brandweek — and the only higher education brand sponsoring an event filled with business-to-consumer and business-to-business brands — Purdue Global, Purdue’s online university for working adults, will highlight the numerous stories used in the launch of its latest brand and marketing platform, “This Is My Comeback.”

Brandweek features more than 24 expert-led sessions, with more than 800 senior-level marketers and industry leaders slated to attend. Celebrities including actor Chris Hemsworth, who founded health and wellness tech brand Centr, and NBA All-Star, entrepreneur and philanthropist Carmelo Anthony will join brand experts from leading companies including UPS, the National Football League, The Coca-Cola Co., Lenovo, T-Mobile and Verizon to talk about strategies in growing brand relevance and loyalty.
“Starting with an incredible product, the Purdue brand is well respected for being on the cutting edge, with recent independent research affirming that it is one of the 10 most visible and recognized university brands in the world. More importantly, however, its strength is reflected in the passion of our students, faculty, staff, alumni, fans and supporters,” said R. Ethan Braden, executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer for Purdue University and Purdue Global. “With the support of Purdue Global’s forward-thinking board of directors and leadership team, we are now telling the incredible stories of working adults who are pursuing a degree that is backed by Purdue University. Purdue Global is about real opportunity for more students. We’re excited to come to Brandweek and have conversations and spark collaborations with top leaders and marketers based on what we have learned and where Purdue Global can go moving forward.”
Braden will be a Main Stage speaker Sept. 13 and will present “Future FWRD: Who Is the Future Marketer?” with Lola Bakare of be/co, Ross Simmonds of Foundation and Adweek CEO Will Lee.
Purdue Global’s own comeback started with conversations among Braden, Purdue Global Chancellor Frank Dooley and Kati Pratt, executive director of brand and marketing strategy for Purdue Marketing and Communications (Purdue MarCom). The three collaborated on what defines a Purdue Global education and experience in a crowded online market, tapping the more than 40 million Americans who have some college credit but no degree.
“This Is My Comeback” launched in April. Purdue MarCom engaged with longtime partners Ologie and BrandTrust, which also helped with Purdue University’s rebranding in 2020. A cross-functional team conducted extensive research over a 12-month period with Purdue Global students, prospective students, student advisors, faculty, alumni and business partners. Three themes emerged from the research:
Students want a university that will help them prepare for what’s next in their lives and careers.
As working adults, they want to feel valued and get credit for what they know and have already done.
They want a degree they can trust and be proud of — one that is backed by Purdue.
“Purdue University celebrates its mission as a land-grant university by making education accessible to more people. We’re excited for Purdue Global to meet this 21st-century challenge from around Indiana, across the U.S. and around the world,” Braden said. “Purdue Global’s leadership, faculty and staff always find ways to expand access and utilize real-world experience for their classes to help working adult students who are balancing work and family while earning their degrees.”
With 34,000 students enrolled and an estimated 11,000 degrees and certificates awarded each year, the current student snapshot at Purdue Global includes these data points:
59% of students are 30 years of age or older.
40% of students are from underserved populations.
52% of students have a child or other dependents.
50% are first-generation college students.
Approximately 10,000 are military-affiliated students, a population that includes uniformed personnel, veterans and eligible dependents.
Under Braden’s leadership, Purdue’s marketing teams have received numerous honors for its work. Braden was the recipient of the American Marketing Association’s 2020 Higher Education Marketer of the Year award, and Purdue MarCom was named AMA Foundation’s Higher Education Marketing Team of the Year in 2020. Inclusion at this year’s Brandweek shows that Purdue Global and Purdue both have high brand value and can compete against business-to-consumer and business-to-business brands.
Its “What Can You Imagine at Purdue?” YouTube video, which has more than 28 million views since launching in November 2022, was recently a winner for Best Motivational Video or Video Series in the 2023 Content Marketing Awards. The video follows a young girl on her educational journey — from completing high school at Purdue Polytechnic High Schools and then going on to Purdue’s flagship campus in West Lafayette — as well as her father’s journey as he completes his degree with Purdue Global. Several other initiatives, such as the award-winning and top-ranked “This Is Purdue” podcast and The Persistent Pursuit content hub, also were finalists in their respective Content Marketing Award categories.
Online education is often categorized as remote learning, something that can be done anywhere by anyone.
As Purdue Global’s leaders have conveyed, it’s more than that. The person logging onto a laptop for classwork is a real human being.
And how students represent themselves on the screen is often different from what is happening in real life.
Take Desiré Hunter. A single mother of four, Hunter was holding down two jobs and figuring out how to chase her dream of getting a master’s degree in psychology. She sat down at her computer one Saturday evening, searching for online schools, when she came upon Purdue Global.
“Purdue Global was a comeback for me because I was a divorced mom, and I was reentering the workplace and at that time I needed to redefine myself,” Hunter said. “Purdue helped me achieve that by first reigniting my dream and reigniting in such a way that allowed me to see more of who I am and to be able to give more and to be an example, especially for my kids at that time.”
The highlight for her was graduation, where she walked across the stage to a roaring crowd — most of it coming from her family.
“When I walked up to get my degree, the chancellor said, ‘You have a fan club.’ My kids were having a competition to see who could scream the loudest, yelling, ‘That’s my mom!’ That was exciting to hear because they walked with me through this process.”
Capturing stories like Hunter’s involves assembling a highly skilled and motivated cross-functional team that includes professionals who specialize in photography, videography, graphic design, social media, data analysis, writers, project management and public/media relations.
“Our team has gone to great lengths to build this brand by capturing these stories and visiting students and alums in their own communities,” Pratt said. “The Purdue Global team has made the students and alumni comfortable during these sessions so that we can capture their authentic stories and use them across all of our marketing and media platforms.”
During the past six months, team members have captured stories for Purdue Global’s page on The Persistent Pursuit, social media and videos in Chicago, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne and Bloomington, Illinois, as well as at commencements in West Lafayette and Anaheim, California. Stories and videos are used across social media, media relations and more, including sporting events, as Purdue Global is in the second year of a multiyear sponsorship with Purdue Athletics.
“We are building a brand that matters by sharing stories from students like Desiré. As Purdue’s online university for working adults, Purdue Global provides a degree working adults are proud of and their employers respect,” Pratt said.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey. Purdue Global is a nonprofit, public university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and backed by Purdue University. For more information, visit https://stories.purdue.edu/purdue-global/.

September recognized as National Suicide Prevention Month; resources available to help,"summarize:Suicide is an uncomfortable topic to discuss, but one that should be discussed openly and honestly. To help raise awareness and open the dialogue, September is recognized as National Suicide Prevention Month. According to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, nearly 1.7 million American adults attempt suicide each year and 2.3 million seriously consider it. This month is a time to focus on raising awareness while learning to recognize concerns that can contribute to a high suicide rate.
The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline’s message for National Suicide Prevention Month — and all year long — is #BeThe1To, which helps spread the word about the five actions everyone can take to help prevent suicide. Those actions are:
Ask: Research shows that talking about suicide tends to reduce suicide ideation.
Be There: Speaking with a non-judgmental person can reduce feelings of depression, etc.
Keep Them Safe: Studies show that reducing lethal means helps reduce suicide rates.
Help Them Stay Connected: Helping individuals create a network of support can help them feel more hopeful.
Follow-up: Ongoing contact can help prevent death by suicide.
SupportLinc, provider of behavioral health services for Purdue’s West Lafayette campus, offers a variety of resources, including in-the-moment phone support, coaching, counseling, online courses, videos, tip sheets and articles, like its “Suicide Prevention Awareness.” Also, keep in mind that Supportlinc offers group trainings that can be set up virtually on the topic of Mental Health First Aid. A version for managers and supervisors as well as one geared toward employees is available.
To start utilizing SupportLinc’s services, call 888-881-5462 or log in to the SupportLinc website or eConnect® mobile app (available in the App Store and on Google Play) with username “purdue.”
An important part — the first step actually — of suicide prevention is recognizing the warning signs and taking them seriously, as well as knowing how to respond to them. Warning signs of suicide include:
Talking about suicide
Looking for access to guns, pills, knives, etc.
Having a preoccupation with death
Sudden mood swings or personality changes
Hopelessness
Self-loathing/hatred
Neglecting appearance
Changes in eating and sleeping patterns
Saying goodbye
Withdrawal
Self-destructive behavior
See the SupportLinc article, “Warning Signs of Suicidal Behavior,” to learn more about warning signs and ways to help someone in need.
Mental Health First Aid — Purdue Extension has a team of certified facilitators of Mental Health First Aid (an eight-hour training to teach participants how to help someone who is developing a mental health problem or experiencing a mental health crisis) able to bring this important, lifesaving course to your campus community, organization or department.
Additionally, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention offers many training resources as does the group Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE), which provides tools to community leaders to help prevent suicide.
During September, when the focus is on raising awareness for suicide prevention, it’s easier for individuals to join in to support those around them and in their communities. However, that support is needed all year long regardless of whether an individual is directly helping someone in need. There are many ways to get and stay involved. Share information about suicide and suicide prevention on social media to help reduce the associated stigma associated. Keep the dialogue going with family and friends about the need for increased awareness and support. Volunteer at a local crisis shelter or similar organization. Donate to agencies that work nonstop to provide support and services for individuals in need.
SupportLinc will present a Healthy Boiler workshop titled “Suicide Awareness” on Sept. 6 at multiple times throughout the day. The workshop supports the behavioral health pillar of the Healthy Boiler Program.
The purpose of the workshop is to raise awareness of suicide and other serious emotional health concerns and provide important information about getting help for someone who may be thinking about suicide.

"IHT Group to manufacture, sell hog-cooling technology developed at Purdue","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. and WINNIPEG, Manitoba —
IHT Group, a division of Decisive Dividend Corp. (TSXV: DE) based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, is bringing patented cooling pad technology for hogs to the North American market in spring 2024.
The pads are 2-foot-by-4-foot aluminum tread plates on top of copper pipes that circulate water. Sensors in the pads determine if the hog is too hot and circulate new water to keep the pad cool. The technology was designed by researchers in Purdue University’s Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering and Department of Animal Sciences.
IHT Group, a division of Decisive Dividend Corp. (TSXV: DE) based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, is bringing patented cooling pad technology for hogs to the North American market in spring 2024.
The pads are 2-foot-by-4-foot aluminum tread plates on top of copper pipes that circulate water. Sensors in the pads determine if the hog is too hot and circulate new water to keep the pad cool. The technology was designed by researchers in Purdue University’s Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering and Department of Animal Sciences.
Schinckel said the initial research showed the cooling pads make sows more comfortable.
“We saw a decrease in their overall respiration rates, slightly lower internal temperatures and lower daily maximum temperatures. The sows also produced more heat, which corresponded to an increase in their feed intake and milk production; this improves animal welfare and well-being,” Schinckel said. “Piglets who were on the cooling pads had a 26% increase in weaning weight and 7.2% increase in feed intake.”
The initial research at Purdue also showed the cooling pads maintained boars’ semen quality by reducing heat stress abnormalities. The pads kept the boars cool even at high environmental temperatures and high humidity. They also kept the boars’ respiration rate low.
Peer-reviewed papers about the initial research have been published in journals including Applied Engineering in Agriculture, Applied Animal Science, Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Journal of Animal Science, Livestock Science, The Professional Animal Scientist and the Journal of the ASABE (American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers).
Schinckel will present a poster about the effects of cooling pads on sows prior to farrowing and mid and late lactation at the Allen D. Leman Swine Conference, which takes place Sept. 16-19 at Saint Paul RiverCentre in Minnesota.
Initial research on the cooling pads’ effects on boars, sows and gilts conducted at Purdue was funded by grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Agricultural Science and Extension for Economic Development, or AgSEED, program from Purdue’s College of Agriculture. IHT Group supported beta tests at Pipestone Research in Minnesota, led by Cabezon, and at Purdue and two commercial facilities in the U.S. IHT Group funded a graduate student at Purdue during the beta test period. Data from those tests is being complied for summarization for analyses.
IHT evaluated pads for their commercial assessment under a Commercial Evaluation Agreement with the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization. Based on the results of the evaluation, IHT and OTC negotiated an exclusive license for manufacturing and selling the pads.
“We will sell the pads across North America in spring 2024 as farmers prepare for the heat stress of the summer,” Grant said. “That launch date will also allow us to compile and analyze final data from the boar stud tests, which will be available in October.”
IHT Group is committed to providing energy-efficient heating and lighting solutions for a wide range of agricultural and commercial applications. We care about animal health, welfare and offering reliable equipment manufactured to save our customers time on maintenance and money on their electric bills. With over 25 years of experience in manufacturing equipment for the agricultural industry, IHT is committed to researching new innovative technologies and providing reliable customer support.

Second funding round delivers $19 million to Purdue-led microelectronics workforce development program,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University on Wednesday (Aug. 30) announced that the SCALE (Scalable Asymmetric Lifecycle Engagement) microelectronics workforce development program will receive more than $19 million in funding from the Department of Defense to strengthen existing efforts in key research areas and to add new academic partners.
The second installment of the DoD’s funding enhances efforts in areas including radiation-hardened microelectronics and trusted artificial intelligence and expands student training, continuing education and dissemination. It includes $3.8 million for Purdue, $5 million for Indiana University and $1.6 million for Vanderbilt University.
Some of these subjects are the focus at several universities that have been added as SCALE partners: Morgan State University, a historically Black college or university in Baltimore; the University of Tulsa; and the Microelectronics Security Training Center, headquartered at the University of Florida.
The SCALE program is the nation’s preeminent workforce development effort, funded by the DoD’s Trusted and Assured Microelectronics  program and managed by Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division. Purdue leads a public-private-academic partnership of now 19 universities and 48 partners within the defense industry and government.
Peter Bermel, SCALE director and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue, said the new funding will significantly expand this work, which is founded on Purdue’s Next Moves in national security and technology.
“Now, more students interested in these technical areas have more opportunities to get involved and develop in-demand skills and experiences,” Bermel said. “And we add these new partner universities while broadening the participation of current partner universities in SCALE.”
The SCALE partners regularly meet to update a prioritized list of knowledge, skills and abilities that are most needed for new entrants to the microelectronics and trusted artificial intelligence workforce.
“Understanding the most current technical and professional workforce skills in microelectronics is imperative for SCALE universities to fully develop students to meet those specialized workforce needs,” said Jennifer Linvill, SCALE director of workforce needs and assistant professor of technology leadership and innovation at Purdue.
As a result, SCALE universities will need to upgrade their classes, projects and research to ensure that students can meet the rapidly advancing needs of the field.
SCALE has a mission to bolster next-generation workforce development to bring the United States back to prominence in global microelectronics research and manufacturing. The demand for microelectronics increased 26% in 2021. But while the United States consumes about half of the chips produced worldwide, only about 12% are manufactured here. That is down from 37% roughly 30 years before.
Workforce development needs this kind of funding, Bermel said, especially to amplify the number of U.S. citizens who can work on these technologies.
“The expectation from multiple credible studies is there will be major shortages in the microelectronics workforce on a national scale if we do nothing. Part of the reason is that fewer U.S. students are going into undergraduate and graduate studies in high-tech areas,” he said, like electrical engineering.
At the same time, there is more money going into the actual technologies, Bermel said. “To achieve the goals of the CHIPS and Science Act, we need a deep pool of talented and motivated people who can do the work at the highest standards,” he said.
That talent pool must include both technical expertise and as much diversity as possible “to draw skilled and capable individuals from all parts of the country to meet the need and to benefit communities throughout the United States,” he said.
“In that sense, Morgan State joining SCALE with expertise in system-on-chip technology is a very important part of the story,” Bermel said, encouraging engineering students at historically Black colleges and universities and underrepresented minorities at all institutions to strongly consider careers in semiconductors and microelectronics.
Purdue is a national leader in microelectronics device and packaging research, spanning the semiconductor ecosystem in software and hardware. The funding announcement is the latest piece of Purdue’s continually expanding research and development in microelectronics and semiconductors. Purdue already has established excellence in other key research areas considered critical to national security, including microelectronics. Strategic initiatives such as the first comprehensive Semiconductor Degrees Program, which were announced before the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022, are intended to prepare a next-generation workforce for industry, while a separate partnership with SkyWater Technology, known as the READI Semiconductors Workforce Development initiative in Greater Lafayette, will support SkyWater’s planned $1.8 billion future state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facility.

Purdue streak camera innovation could capture actions that last femtoseconds or less,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Imagine an action that occurs within a femtosecond, or one-quadrillionth of a second: atomic transitions, charge transfers and dynamics, biochemical processes. Now imagine being able to record that action so it can be studied in further detail.
Purdue University engineers are developing a patent-pending tool that scientists in academia and industry can use to record those ultrafast actions better than with traditional technology.
Traditional electronic-based streak cameras are essential for recording phenomena that last mere picoseconds, or one-trillionth of a second. Scientists developed these cameras by converting light to electrons, then “streaking” them across a detector to form an image, said Colton Fruhling, a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University’s Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
“Think of the electrons like water coming out of a hose and the detector like dry pavement,” Fruhling said. “If a person quickly pulls the hose to the side, the water before the hose moved continues to go straight; the water that comes out during the motion is displaced to the side. In this way, the water that comes out of the hose at different times lands in different positions on the pavement.
“If someone wants to measure something really fast — for example, a person slicing their hand through the water — scientists can look at the pavement where the water didn’t hit and measure its length to figure out how fast the hand was moving.”
However, traditional electronic-based streak cameras, which use today’s fastest electronic circuits, have drawbacks. Fruhling said the biggest is their limited time resolution.
“There are some processes that occur in 100 femtoseconds or less; a femtosecond is one-quadrillionth of a second,” Fruhling said. “But today’s commercial electronic-based streak cameras can only resolve 600 to 800 femtoseconds. There is a whole world of physics that lasts a femtosecond and even an attosecond, or one-quintillionth of a second, that is undiscovered.”
Fruhling said Purdue’s streak camera uses all-optical mechanisms, which have the potential to speed up the process by 10,000 to 100,000 times. The research was led by Vladimir M. Shalaev, the Bob and Anne Burnett Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering; Alexandra Boltasseva, the Ron and Dotty Garvin Tonjes Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering; and Alexander V. Kildishev, professor in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
The patent-pending Purdue innovation uses materials called epsilon-near-zero materials.
“A secondary light pulse changes their optical properties. This means the method is completely optical and not limited by electronic circuits used in traditional streak cameras,” Fruhling said.
“The technology could be utilized by physicists and engineers who want to study ultrafast processes like atomic transitions, by chemists who study charge transfer in reactions, and by biologists who want to study protein folding. It could also be used for companies that want to study the charge dynamics in next-generation computer chips.”
Fruhling said the research team has created each component of the device and tested them separately.
“We have shown that the optical properties can be dramatically changed over about 100 femtoseconds,” Fruhling said. “From the experimental results, we can simulate the resulting streaking performances to be around five attoseconds, which is 100,000 times faster. These tests have been simulations, and final experiments are being designed.”
The streak camera innovation was disclosed to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent on the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in further developing the technology for the marketplace should contact Will Buchanan, assistant director of business development, physical sciences, wdbuchanan@prf.org, about 2023-SHAL-70258.
The Purdue research team has received funding from the Department of Energy, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Office of Naval Research to support this work.

Purdue Digital Forestry team advances to $10 million XPRIZE Rainforest competition finals,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University competitors for XPRIZE Rainforest, a global cross-disciplinary challenge of monitoring tropical biodiversity, and their Illinois Institute of Technology teammates endured some tense moments in the semifinals, held in Singapore earlier this year.
But after overcoming multiple challenges, including a nail-biter in the last minutes of the competition, the team recently learned it has qualified to compete in next year’s $10 million XPRIZE Rainforest finals. Team Welcome to the Jungle, led by Illinois Tech’s Matthew Spenko, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, also includes members from Natural State and the Morton Arboretum.
Natural State developed artificial intelligence and machine learning models to automatically identify animal species from Illinois Tech’s sound and video recordings. Morton Arboretum used Purdue’s aerial images to identify tree species.
“Working collaboratively, our team has been able to obtain crucial insights about the health and biodiversity of the rainforest,” said Jinha Jung, associate professor in Purdue’s Lyles School of Civil Engineering. “Our joint efforts illustrate the power of interuniversity collaboration in addressing critical environmental challenges.”
Jung is a member of Purdue’s Institute for Digital Forestry. One of the five strategic initiatives in Purdue’s Next Moves, the institute leverages digital technology and multidisciplinary expertise to measure, monitor and manage urban and rural forests to maximize social, economic and ecological benefits.
Among the many teams that initially entered the five-year XPRIZE Rainforest competition, 36 teams competed in the qualifying round, with 13 advancing to the semifinals. The Illinois Tech-Purdue team was one of only two that were able to seamlessly cover the entire 60 hectares (about 150 acres) of rainforest in the semifinal test area.
The Purdue members of the team led the aerial surveying to measure vegetation, identify canopy trees, quantify tree species diversity and determine potential sensor deployment locations. The Purdue team consists of Jung, along with Joshua Carpenter and Hansae Kim, both PhD students in Jung’s Geospatial Data Science Lab. Kim contributed to the data analysis portion of the competition remotely from West Lafayette.
The 13 semifinalist teams had 24 hours to collect as much biodiversity data as possible in a natural rainforest area in the middle of urban Singapore, and another 48 hours for analysis.
“Not everything went smoothly. There were many challenges,” Jung said. Many of the challenges arose during the data-collection period. Members of the Illinois Tech robotics group had developed sensor packages that they dropped into the forest canopy with a drone. Each of the team’s five sensor packages contained a sound recorder and a video device.
Jung and Carpenter, meanwhile, flew their drones to take multispectral and natural color imagery of the canopy. “We had quite a bit of trouble figuring out a safe way to autonomously run our drones,” Carpenter said. They ended up following a path that, because of the forest canopy, unavoidably meant periodically losing radio connection with the drone while it flew on its own.
“We could expect it to get close enough for a connection about once every two or three minutes,” Carpenter said. During those nerve-racking minutes, they had no idea about the drone’s status. “It could have crashed. We’re sitting there just waiting, waiting, waiting for the radio signal to come back.”
Jung’s group has successfully flown drones in dense forests previously. “Before we always had the freedom to go where we want to take off so that we can consistently maintain line of sight and the signal,” he said. But competition rules required them to work within a specified area covered by a dense rainforest canopy that blocked the drone’s signal.
Locating and retrieving all five of Illinois Tech’s deployed sensor packages from the forest canopy triggered another traumatic moment. Contest rules required that all deployed equipment needed to be retrieved at the end of the data-collection period to keep the rainforest pristine. But initially, the team could locate and retrieve only four of the packages.
Suddenly, with about 15 minutes left on the clock, the team figured out the likely location of the missing package. Within about 10 minutes, the team spotted the package, collected it with a drone and returned it to base camp.
“With five minutes on the clock, we were able to retrieve everything that was deployed. We were really pumped about that,” Carpenter said.
The format for the final contest will be similar to the semifinals, but in a more remote and challenging location. The winning team will survey the most biodiversity contained in 100 hectares (247 acres) of tropical rainforest in 24 hours and produce the most impactful real-time insights within 48 hours. The other five finalists are teams based in New Haven, Connecticut; Grand Junction, Colorado; Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Barcelona, Spain; and Zurich, Switzerland.
“We have a unique set of skills that allow us to be highly impactful,” Carpenter said. “We team up with people who have the scientific knowledge. When we have the chance to bring those skills to bear to help improve the world, we want to do it.”

A ‘mini-brain’ traces the link between concussion and Alzheimer’s disease,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
How much time elapses between a blow to the head and the start of damage associated with Alzheimer’s disease?
A device that makes it possible to track the effects of concussive force on a functioning cluster of brain cells suggests the answer is in hours. The “traumatic brain injury (TBI) on a chip” being developed at Purdue University opens a window into a cause and effect that announces itself with the passage of decades but is exceedingly difficult to trace back to its origins.
“We’re basically creating a miniature brain that we can hit and then study,” said Riyi Shi, lead researcher and the Mari Hulman George Endowed Professor of Applied Neuroscience in Purdue University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “We know there’s a link between TBI and Alzheimer’s; that’s well established in clinical observation. But teasing out the basic essential pathway is not easy. With the TBI on a chip, we’re able to test a lot of hypotheses that would be very difficult to do in living animals.”
In a study recently published in Lab on a Chip, a research team led by Shi subjected functioning clusters of cultured neurons from embryonic mice to three blows of 200 g-force, each approximating the higher end of what a football player receives in a single hit. The trauma leads to an immediate surge in production of acrolein — a molecule associated with oxidative stress and neurodegenerative disease — and a rise in misfolded clumps of the protein amyloid beta 42 (AB42), which is found in masses called plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Additional experiments traced the links among impact, acrolein and AB42.
The device can also be used to test possible therapeutics, including drugs known to reduce acrolein levels. In the current study, Shi’s team used the device to show that the drug hydralazine, a known acrolein scavenger that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for lowering blood pressure, reduces the amount of acrolein and levels of misfolded AB42 produced in the cluster of neurons after a hit. Shi, who has a long history of studying neurodegenerative disease, acrolein and hydralazine, said the TBI on a chip enabled a finding he’s sought over two decades of study.
“Now that we know what’s happening, is there something we can do about it? And the answer is yes,” said Shi, who is also a member of the Purdue Institute for Integrative Neuroscience. “Acrolein is time-dependent; the longer it’s there, the more AB42 aggregation it will cause. Here we show that if we lower acrolein with this drug, we can lower inflammation and AB42 aggregation.”
The device, custom-fabricated at the Purdue Center for Paralysis Research, uses a pendulum to deliver a specific g-force to a small chamber housing a cluster of a quarter million neurons supported by a bed of nutrients. A microelectronic array embedded in the chamber measures the electrical activity of the neurons, which will sustain functional firing patterns for several weeks, while a clear viewing port allows microscopic observation of the neurons. Researchers remove the cluster of neurons from the chamber at intervals to take specific biochemical measurements.
“There’s several unique things that we do here, but one of the biggest is that you can hit this chip without damaging it, so you can give an impact to a live model and continue to study it,” Shi said.
Shi began working on the device in graduate school, incorporating over the course of several decades features that make it possible to study the aftereffects of an initial blow. A 2022 paper in Nature Scientific Reports used the device to show the surge in acrolein that occurs after a hit, and Shi said the most recent findings hint at the power of the model.
“Thanks to this device, people should know that when you get a concussion, you don’t have 10 years before you will see damage,” Shi said. “The clock starts ticking immediately, and if we want to do something about it, we need to act quickly.”
Within the first 24 hours after a hit, results show elevated levels of acrolein in the neuron clusters and a 350% increase in production of misfolded AB42. Shi said acrolein deforms normal AB42 by binding to sections of the protein that contribute to structural stability. Indeed, when the team conducted a simple experiment by combining large amounts of acrolein with normal purified AB42 suspended in fluid, they found elevated levels of misfolded AB42. The properly folded protein is sufficiently fragile that even subjecting normal purified AB42 in fluid (without acrolein) to an impact was enough to provoke misfolding.
“This amyloid beta pathology started within hours, maybe immediately. That’s never been heard of,” Shi said. “It’s like attacking the weight-bearing stud in a house wall. If you break that stud, of course the house is going to fall down.”
Shi was joined in the research by Purdue colleagues Edmond A. Rogers, first author, and co-authors Timothy Beauclair, Jhon Martinez, Shatha J. Mufti, David Kim, Siyuan Sun, Rachel L. Stingel, Nikita Krishnan and Jennifer Crodian, senior research associate at Purdue’s Center for Paralysis Research, as well as Alexandra M. Dieterly of Charles River Laboratory. The study was supported by the state of Indiana, the National Institutes of Health and Plexon Inc.
Moving forward, Shi said, he may be able to incorporate multiple additional features, which would allow the measurements of minute forces that cells experience during the blow, and biochemical testing — like checking levels of acrolein — without removing cells from the chamber. Industry partners interested in further developing or commercializing Shi’s innovation should contact Joseph Kasper of the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization at jrkasper@prf.org.

Purdue Global: Don’t fear generative AI tools in the classroom,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Stuart Collins is always looking for good conversation topics during his American government and civics courses at Purdue Global.
Collins, a faculty member in the School of Multidisciplinary and Professional Studies, recently focused a class discussion on 2023’s debt ceiling negotiations in class, but with a twist: He used a generative artificial intelligence tool, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, during the seminar.
This example of a Purdue Global faculty member’s use of generative AI within an academic context might be a glimpse into the classroom of the future. Purdue Global, which is Purdue’s online university for working adults, is at the forefront of exploring AI opportunities in higher education, with an AI task force drawing on the creativity and innovative thinking of faculty, students and staff.

As Collins screen-shared ChatGPT and walked students through the process of prompting the program, it provided additional historical information about the debt ceiling he was not expecting.
Following the session, Collins reminded the students to verify any information from generative AI against reliable sources and stressed the importance of information literacy.
Collins, who serves on Purdue Global’s AI Task Force, began using generative AI tools in December 2022. He now uses them in class, as well as in his research.
“I realized that 80%-90% of the assignments I had created for my government and civics courses could now be readily answered by AI,” Collins said. “That realization presented quite the problem. We are now thinking about how we can make our courses both AI-amplified and AI-resilient.”
Purdue Global administrators and faculty were already discussing generative AI in sessions at an internal conference in the fall of 2022. They accelerated their exploration of how generative AI tools could change education with a focused AI in Education group launched in January 2023.
“Purdue Global has attempted to be open-minded and forward-thinking about the positive role that artificial intelligence can play in higher education,” said Matthew Braslow, Purdue Global’s director of assessment and research.
The AI Task Force had issued initial guidance for students and faculty on acceptable and unacceptable uses of generative AI for completing coursework. In general, the guidance allowed it as a research aid and to help improve spelling and grammar.
To see how the use of AI was going, Purdue Global distributed a survey and guidance to the student body and faculty. More than 400 students and 100 faculty members responded.
“The vast majority of students and faculty found the guidance clear and helpful, but the real surprise came when students were asked about whether they planned to use generative AI to complete their schoolwork,” Braslow said.
While fewer than 25% of students said that they planned to use AI, nearly 75% of faculty believed that students would use AI to complete their schoolwork. Student responses ranged from equating AI use to cheating to expressing fears of being accused of plagiarism.
Braslow said it is important to find a balance in using generative AI programs as a tool, especially as Purdue Global students are working adult learners and many students have indicated they are already using generative AI programs in the workplace.
The task force is creating resources and guidelines to help educators understand how higher education can teach and leverage the power of AI. Items such as curriculum guides; professional development courses; and mission, vision and value statements are in final stages of review.
Purdue Global Provost Jon Harbor says it is essential for higher education institutions to actively adopt new policies and integrate AI into the classroom and coursework while finding a way for students and faculty to use the programs.
“Embracing AI in higher education at institutions like Purdue Global is crucial to staying relevant, fostering innovation, enhancing educational quality and preparing students for the opportunities and demands of an AI-powered future,” Harbor said. “Finding common ground ensures that AI is used responsibly, ethically and in a way that maximizes its benefits for both educators and learners.”
Austin Lawton, a student from Noblesville, Indiana, pursuing an information technology degree with a focus on programming and software development, embraces generative AI.
Lawton has helped Purdue Global’s AI Task Force with some of its activities, bringing a student perspective. He uses generative AI to assist with his learning and classwork.
“It has been incredibly valuable to have a tool that can help streamline the information acquisition process to essentially augment my understanding of more complex engineering concepts,” he said.
The user-friendly AI programs help him navigate through large amounts of information. While he hasn’t encountered misinformation, he has come across inaccurate coding.
“Using AI like ChatGPT isn’t just about inputting questions and receiving answers. It’s about discovering your own learning curves and gaps in understanding and developing strategies to overcome those,” Lawton said. “My primary concern rests more on the question of control: who gets to decide what AI can and cannot generate, and where the line is between accuracy and truth.”
He is grateful that Purdue Global has embraced AI rather than suppressing or dismissing the technology and that administrators and faculty are working with students to figure out next steps.
His vision involves a “private student AI,” which would be a personalized educational companion for each student. The program would have the ability to remind a person of upcoming deadlines, assist with study sessions and identify areas of struggle.
“As we navigate this era where access to knowledge is unprecedented, it’s essential to consider how AI can shape our future. I see AI as an invaluable guide, a resource that is always present, like a mentor providing advice and insights rather than dictating actions. It holds immense promise for the evolution of learning and, in a broader sense, the human experience,” Lawton said.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey. Purdue Global is a nonprofit, public university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and backed by Purdue University. For more information, visit https://stories.purdue.edu/purdue-global/.

Work progresses on several capital projects as new academic year begins on West Lafayette campus,"summarize:Progress on various capital projects will continue on the West Lafayette campus as another academic year begins. In addition to campus construction, projects throughout the city of West Lafayette could also have an impact on travel.
The following road, sidewalk and parking restrictions will be in place in the coming months:
Ross-Ade Stadium: John R. Wooden Drive will remain closed throughout the month of August from north of Tower Drive to south of Joe Tiller Drive as renovations at Ross-Ade Stadium wrap up. Both sidewalks on either side of John R. Wooden Drive also remain closed. Additionally, Tower Drive from John R. Wooden Drive to Steven C. Beering Drive has been converted to a one-way for westbound traffic only. The closure and impacts are expected to be lifted in time for the first home football game on Sept. 2.
Life Science Ranges Phenotyping Greenhouse Building: South Russell Street, just south of Mitch Daniels Boulevard, is scheduled to close Sept. 5 for construction of the Life Science Ranges Phenotyping Greenhouse Building. The closure is expected to last until January 2025.
Max W & Maileen Brown Family Hall: As part of renovations for the Max W & Maileen Brown Family Hall (BHEE), temporary walls block off the first-floor construction area. All building entrances remain open with access to the lower and upper floors. The main lecture hall, BHEE 129, is still accessible from the main entry off of Northwestern Avenue. The renovations are expected to be complete in August 2024.
Data Science: As progress continues on renovations for the new data science facility, formerly Schleman Hall of Student Services, the building remains closed, and some exterior restrictions remain in place. These restrictions include fenced-off sidewalks around the facility and a partial closure of the Armory parking lot. The renovations are expected to be complete in spring 2024.
Black Cultural Center and Third Street: Fencing remains near the west side of the Black Cultural Center as a utility project nears completion. Access to the main entrance of the center is still being maintained with the west entrance serving as an emergency exit only. The Third Street corridor remains open while fencing is in place. The project is expected to be completed in mid-October.
Additionally, the university recently reduced speed limits in an effort to increase safety on and around campus.
The projects listed above are part of a 2023 snapshot of recently completed, ongoing and planned capital projects demonstrating more than $1.3 billion in facilities investments. The projects are outlined on a recently created major capital project map, which also shows upcoming planned investments in student housing.
Updates about capital and road projects will continue to be posted on the Physical Facilities construction and travel notices webpage.

Purdue researchers from Chemistry have identified that quantum interference plays a critical role in chemical processes that hold the key to the efficiency of energy transport in photosynthesis and solar cells. Contrary to prior belief, the findings show that energy efficiency can be increased by exploiting different quantum phase relationships. The study suggests that devices with high densities and mobilities of excitons can be realized through detailed control of quantum phases through the packing motifs in which molecules crystallize, with applications in optoelectronics and quantum information science. It furthermore paves the way for advanced molecular material design by harnessing quantum interference as a principal ingredient.",[{'summary_text': 'researchers have identified the critical role that quantum interference plays in chemical processes like photosynthesis and transporting energy in solar cells . the study suggests devices with high densities and mobilities of excitons can be realized through detailed control of quantum phases .'}]
U.S. News: Purdue’s Education online master’s degree programs rank among top 7% nationally,"summarize:About This Series: This story is part of an ongoing Purdue Today series highlighting programs ranked in the Top 10 or Top 10th percentile among our peers nationally, demonstrating the university’s persistent pursuit of excellence, innovation and transformative learning.
Megan Isle is excited about the impact she is having for her clients as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst at Circle City ABA’s office in Lafayette, which offers services for children with autism. And she points to the rigorous preparation she gained through Purdue’s College of Education online master’s degree programs, ranked among the top 7% nationally.
“Purdue has done an excellent job preparing me for my career as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. I now have a career that I love and where I can make a difference,” Isle says.
The 2023 rankings, by U.S. News & World Report in January, position Purdue’s College of Education online graduate programs at No. 23 overall, with two other programs inside the top 20: instructional media design (learning design and technology) at No. 8, and curriculum and instruction at No. 19. A total of 338 programs were included in the 2023 survey.
“These high national rankings of our online graduate programs are a testament to our award-winning faculty and dedicated staff,” says Wayne E. Wright, associate dean for research, graduate programs and faculty development in the College of Education. “They are fully committed to ensuring our students receive the highest quality of instruction in a meaningful, engaging and interactive online learning environment.”
Online Boilermaker students appreciate the flexibility of being able to earn a graduate degree while working full time and they feel well-prepared by the Purdue program for the real world.\“I especially love the focus that Purdue education has with equality and civil issues. It really helped educate me on how to adjust to students’ needs these days,” says English teacher Layne Kirchoff, Batesville Community School Corp. in Batesville, Indiana.
Ryan Freeman, also an English teacher at Lake Central High School in St. John, Indiana, chose Purdue’s online Transition to Teaching program because of its asynchronous schedule and remote coursework. “It allowed me to continue working full time as a substitute teacher,” he says. “My course assignments often paired well with what I encountered firsthand in a school environment.”
Adds Sarah Gaulke, who teaches special education in Pendleton, Oregon, “The Purdue program was the only master’s program I could find that was set up to prepare me for initial licensure while working full time, fully online for this rural Oregonian, and with a reputation of a high-quality program.
Wright emphasizes that each year, Purdue’s College of Education strives to continually improve its programs and relies on the rankings to help promote and serve as a recruiting tool for prospective students seeking a quality online educational experience.
Doctoral degrees are available in educational leadership and policy studies and higher education (both hybrid).
Teachers can earn licensures in educational leadership building level, English language learning, high ability, special education (licensure only), and Transition to Teaching.
Graduate certificates are available in applied behavior analysis; dual language bilingual education; gifted, creative, and talented studies; K-12 integrated STEM education; and teaching English language learners. This summer, the college also launched certificate programs in instructional design and leadership development for career and technical education.
Megan Engelberth, a seventh grade English teacher in the Whitley County Consolidated Schools in Columbia City, Indiana, says the online master’s program through Purdue’s College of Education challenged the misconceptions she had toward gifted learners. “I was able to learn strategies and techniques to put to use in my classroom to create valuable learning opportunities for these students and push them to reach their potential,” she says.

"Strength, value of Purdue-Colombia partnership felt in the career-changed lives of over 500 participants as program marks 10 years","summarize:Ana Maria Ulloa Gómez was a dentistry student in 2017 when she came to Purdue University’s campus as part of the Undergraduate Research Experience Purdue-Colombia program to work alongside materials engineering professor Lia Stanciu and focus on biomaterials research.
During her Purdue semester-long stint six years ago, she studied a Type 1 collagen coating for enhancing the integration of an iron-based alloy to the bone. She understood the iron-based alloy’s promise as a suitable material to manufacture new implants. Little did Ulloa Gómez realize her life would be forever changed by her time at Purdue as a college senior.
Once she completed her undergraduate studies and involvement in the program, known as UREP-C, Ulloa Gómez moved from dentistry to materials engineering. And her Boilermaker experience had another chapter: Ulloa Gomez decided to pursue a PhD here. She completed her doctoral dream in in just four years, in December 2022, in researching the development of electrochemical and colorimetric sensing platforms for agriculture and health care applications.
Now a senior research specialist for Dow Chemical Co., Ulloa Gómez is part of a select collection of over 500 UREP-C program participants from the South American country of Colombia who are making a major impact, many in their home country and others throughout the U.S. and Europe.
“My time at Purdue was incredibly rewarding,” says Gomez, who is based at Dow Chemical’s major research facility in Midland, Michigan. “The UREP-C program was life-changing. I am so grateful for the opportunities the program gave me.
UREP-C, a research-based mobility program launched a decade ago, is fostering educational and cultural enrichment for undergraduates from underserved communities throughout Colombia, according to Juan Diego Velásquez, Purdue’s assistant director of global partnerships and director of Latin American Programs and the Colombia-Purdue Partnership.
Through this innovative global engagement program, Colombian students study for six months at Purdue’s main campus, partnering with faculty from both countries to conduct research. Each visiting student also is matched with a current Colombian Purdue graduate student, a local host family and Purdue-enrolled native speakers.
“A lot of doors to the potential opportunities for these students at Purdue are opened because of other types of collaborations faculty might have with Colombia or universities there,” Velásquez says. “The students also have become the best ambassadors within Colombia and the program that I can have.”

Purdue-Colombia program expands; similar efforts planned for Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru
Since February, Alison Sofia Mesa Canizales has had the opportunity to work alongside renown Purdue researcher Rakesh Agrawal, the Winthrop E. Stone Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering. Agrawal served as her advisor, and PhD student Shabhansu Agarwal was her mentor.
She presented her senior project during the program’s final symposium on July 19. Titled “Solution-Processed BaZrS3 With Low-Cost Molecular Precursors: A Game-Changer for Tandem Solar Cell Advancements on a Budget,” the project examined the benefits of using low-cost materials, specifically chalcogenide perovskite, for producing more affordable solar cells.
Sparked by her Purdue experience, she plans to pursue an advanced degree in chemical engineering.  And becoming a Boilermaker graduate student remains high on her list of choices before Mesa Canizales goes into industry.
“I will always remember my time at Purdue,” she says. “I wanted to focus on renewable energy. And through my experience and the tremendous opportunity to work with Professor Agrawal and PhD student Shabhansu Agarwal, I gained access to new tools, cutting-edge laboratories and new knowledge, preparing me for the next steps in my career.”
Undergraduate Research Experience Purdue-Colombia
Boon for Colombian students, Purdue and society
Purdue Office of Global Partnerships
Daniel Felipe Pinzón Quintero had a life-changing experience — and knew he also was blazing a trail for future students in the program. Of the 40 Colombian students in the spring 2023 cohort, he was one of only two students from the College of Liberal Arts.
Advised by Purdue sociology professor Jeremy Reynolds, Pinzón Quintero examined the work schedules for gig workers for a final presentation titled, “Work Schedule Fit and Platform: Dependence among Gig Workers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk Platform.” The core of the research, Reynolds says, is being submitted to journals for potential publication, with Pinzón Quintero as a co-author.
“I’ve grown a lot. And because of my Purdue experience in this program, the person I am today is completely different than who I was six months ago,” says Pinzón Quintero, who now plans to pursue a doctorate in sociology and become a professor and researcher.
Reynolds was excited to partner with UREP-C and advise Pinzón Quintero. For Reynolds, UREP-C was a calling. He characterizes his own study abroad experience in Austria as an important and formative time in his college years that helped define his career choice in academia. “Daniel has been super-ambitious and active. He’s done a first-rate job of making the most of his time here at Purdue,” says Reynolds, who joined Purdue’s faculty in 2016.
The Purdue experience for aspiring civil engineer Néstor Fabián Rodríguez Buitrago was just as impactful — both for the rewarding academic opportunities of his time here through UREP-C in 2017, and also the time he spent outside the classroom and laboratory.
While at Purdue, Rodríguez Buitrago’s research focused on the 3D printing of cementitious materials with controlled architectures, working with renowned researchers Jan Olek, the James H. and Carol H. Cure Professor in Civil Engineering, and Pablo Zavattieri, the Jerry M. and Lynda T. Engelhardt Professor in Civil Engineering.
“The idea of being a civil engineer came to me after finding out how much I loved mechanics and chemistry, and after each one of my schoolteachers told me I was going to be an engineer,” Rodríguez Buitrago says.
Rodríguez Buitrago also benefited from another unique aspect of the UREP-C. West Lafayette couple Joe and Opal Wilkerson served as his weekend host in connection with UREP-C and Purdue’s International Friendship Program, exposing the Colombian undergraduate to Midwestern culture, entertainment and the popular sites while traveling throughout Indiana.
“It was an incredibly pleasant experience,” says Joe Wilkerson, members of Covenant Church in West Lafayette who with his wife has hosted four Colombian students during their time at Purdue. “We would take them around Indiana and give them a taste of life in our state. We highly recommend this experience, especially for couples who have elementary and high school students at home. It’s a wonderful way to learn about other cultures in our world that these students wouldn’t otherwise.”
In working with Ulloa Gómez as an undergraduate before she decided to pursue her doctorate at Purdue, Stanciu says Ulloa Gómez was a quick study, showing a passion­­­ to learn and understand concepts and laboratory techniques in areas she was not initially familiar with. That, Stanciu adds, bodes well for the type of students Purdue has grown accustomed to attracting through programs such as UREP-C.
“Ana’s best qualities are her intellectual curiosity, ability to be flexible and not shy away from new topics, intelligence, perseverance, attention to detail and dedication to the team,” Stanciu says. “She is also an excellent team member, who always helps everyone else on her team with no hesitation.”
Ulloa Gómez has advice for the next class of Colombian students arriving this month through UREP-C.
“Once you’re part of the program, plan not for your next six months at Purdue but for your next five years — whether you’re thinking about pursuing graduate school or going into industry,” Gómez says. “As long as you have that mentality, anything’s possible. It can be a game-changer for your career.”","[{'summary_text': 'UREP-C is a research-based mobility program for undergraduates from the south american country of Colombia . the program is partnering with faculty from both countries to conduct research . urep-C students are paired with current purdue graduate students, a local host family and Purdue-enrolled native speakers .'}]"

"Purdue-Colombia undergrad research program expands; similar student engagement efforts planned for Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru","summarize:Building on the decadelong success of an undergraduate student research engagement effort with leading universities in the South American country of Colombia, Purdue University is planning to launch similar programs on a smaller scale to create opportunities for students in Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru.
Purdue established the Undergraduate Research Experience Purdue-Colombia program, known as UREP-C, in 2014, bringing college seniors to the West Lafayette campus for six months to work with Purdue faculty on a senior research project. The inaugural class had 24 students 10 years ago.
As the global COVID-19 pandemic was subsiding, UREP-C was expanded in the fall of 2021 to accommodate spring and fall cohorts of between 40-50 students each, says Juan Diego Velásquez, assistant director of global partnerships at Purdue and director of Latin American Programs and the Colombia-Purdue Partnership.
During the just-completed spring and summer 2023 session, 38 students participated. A class of 48 students arrived this week for the fall term, and another 48 students are set to begin their Purdue-Colombia experience in February 2024, Velásquez says.
“We’re creating opportunities. Because of the financial backgrounds of many of these students, we’re opening up the world to those who never thought this world was accessible to them,” Velásquez says. “Many of these students had never been on a plane before. And for most of them, this was the first time they needed a passport to travel outside Colombia.”
Value of Purdue-Colombia partnership felt in the career-changed lives
A similar Purdue program for students from Brazil was launched in 2022 and another is gearing up for undergraduate students from Mexico, Velásquez says. Other programs in the works specifically for the College of Science will reach out to undergraduate students from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
For the first three years, the Purdue-Colombian partnership focused mainly on students in academic areas related to agriculture, engineering and science. That has gradually expanded to include students in other disciplines, including two students this spring and summer from College of Liberal Arts programs, Velásquez says.
“What having a diversified portfolio of different Purdue disciplines available to Colombian students has done has prompted our colleges to find individual and unique ways to connect with what we have in Colombia,” he says. “I don’t speak on behalf of the colleges. I try to connect our Purdue colleges with the Colombian universities that have the right infrastructure, the right mix of offerings, and then I support the process along the way. But I let the colleges choose.”
Undergraduate Research Experience Purdue-Colombia
Institute of International Education’s 2023 Heiskell Awards for Innovation in International Education Honorable Mention: Strategic Partnerships
Institute of International Education
The program experienced a major boost in 2019. That year, Colombian partners and now-Purdue President Mung Chiang, who was the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering at that time, signed agreements to increase to six the number of participating Colombian universities. Added to the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL) in Bogotá that year were Universidad de los Andes (UniAndes) and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá; Universidad de Cartagena in Cartagena; Universidad EAFIT and Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL) Medellín in Medellín; and Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla.
“Building on the success of the program under President Mitch Daniels and now with President Chiang in leadership and the active global approach he has taken makes the work that I do easier, more visible, more impactful and meaningful,” Velásquez says.
With its 2014 launch, the Undergraduate Research Experience Purdue-Colombia was built on the striking parallels that exist between the Colombia of today and the United States when Purdue was established as Indiana’s land-grant university in 1869: war-torn nations with complex multicultural populations, vast underdeveloped territories, and people eager to prosper using new knowledge and technology.
Land-grant universities felt the call to open the doors of higher education to a population without access because of economic and financial constraints, Velásquez says. Today, U.S. universities like Purdue, he adds, are fulfilling that land-grant promise while evolving to address the needs of a globally connected world for the well-being of people here and abroad. That’s evidenced by the success of the Purdue-Colombia collaboration, which is aimed at creating opportunities for underrepresented undergrads in that country.
“We geographically share one continent. If we want to address issues of immigration, if we want to address the issue of social unrest, if we want to help address the economic challenges in that part of the world, we need to help Central and South America, so they have options and opportunities that don’t involve having to migrate to the north,” Velásquez says. “And higher education is the way to do it.”
Additionally, since its inception a decade ago, the international Purdue program has seen more than two-thirds of the students deciding to continue on to graduate school, with many completing doctoral degrees, Velásquez says.
“We have an incredibly compelling story. Purdue has benefited by having more than 70 students coming back for their master’s or PhD degrees,” he says. “There’s probably an equal number of students who have attended other universities around the world – a lot of them in Europe. Probably two-thirds of the students have continued their graduate studies because of their Purdue-Colombia experience.”
The response to the program from Purdue’s faculty community has been “nothing short of amazing,” Velásquez adds. “Now I have faculty members coming to me, asking, ‘Do you have Colombian students in this particular area?’ They have become strong advocates of the program. That’s very different from when we started.”
Moreover, the Purdue program is a model nationally and globally, drawing accolades from leading higher education organizations.
The Institute of International Education, a leader in designing and implementing international education strategies and program services, recognized the Undergraduate Research Experience Purdue-Colombia program in May. Purdue’s program gained an honorable mention in the Strategic Partnerships category as part of the 2023 IIE Andrew Heiskell Awards for Innovation in International Education.
“We’re very proud and honored to have been recognized by IEE, which is the largest U.S. organization focused on international higher education,” Velásquez says.","[{'summary_text': 'UREP-C is a student research engagement program with leading universities in the south american country of Colombia . since its inception a decade ago, the program has seen more than two-thirds of the students deciding to continue on to graduate school . a similar program is gearing up for undergraduate students from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru .'}]"

PhD student’s materials engineering research offers glimpse into challenges of electronic device miniaturization,"summarize:Amey Luktuke, a graduate research assistant in materials engineering at Purdue, recently defended his PhD thesis addressing the effects of miniaturization of electronic devices. In simple terms, in smartphones, computers and other electronic devices, there are multiple components including microchips, transistors and more.
Electronic packaging encompasses the process of enclosing, safeguarding or establishing the physical framework for electronic components or finalized electronic devices. The electronic package serves as a framework that binds these components together, resulting in the creation of a high-performance device.
For decades, the size of an electronic device was determined by the size of a transistor. As the size of a transistor decreased, the device itself also became smaller. Reducing the transistor size further, however, poses significant physical limitations. Therefore, a lot of attention has been given to packaging strategies. Using such strategies, the trend of miniaturization could be continued.
Luktuke says that with the increasingly higher density of interconnects in an electronic package, very dissimilar materials will be sitting next to each other (a lower melting point polymer next to a much higher melting point metal, for example).
He is working to understand the solidification behavior of new, lower temperature interconnects in electronic packaging using advanced X-ray imaging techniques available at the synchrotron at the Advanced Photon Source of the Argonne National Laboratory.
Purdue has a long relationship with Argonne, the nation’s first national laboratory where students, faculty and industry experts can conduct leading-edge basic and applied scientific research in virtually every scientific discipline.
Many Purdue alumni, including 2023 Distinguished Engineering Alumna Valerie Taylor, who is director of the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne, work at the laboratory, which is located just two hours north of the West Lafayette campus and southwest of Chicago.
Luktuke began his doctoral studies in 2018 at Arizona State University in professor Nikhilesh Chawla’s research group. When Chawla, the Ransburg Professor in Materials Engineering, joined the Purdue faculty in 2020, he presented an opportunity for Luktuke to continue his doctoral studies at Purdue.
“To be honest, it was an easy decision for me to come to Purdue,” Luktuke says. “I was well aware of Purdue University’s remarkable research environment, outstanding facilities and the extensive engineering legacy it holds. Moreover, I was able to continue the same research that I started at ASU.”
Luktuke’s research has focused on solder alloys that can be used for advanced electronic packaging.
Heterogeneous integration packaging (HIP) has emerged as a promising strategy because it not only reduces the size of electronic devices but also enhances their overall performance. HIP involves integrating separately manufactured components into a higher-level assembly. Solder joints are used to provide electrical connections between various components. This is done by melting the alloy between those components and solidifying them to form a connection.
In the advanced packages, solder alloys are positioned in close proximity to lower melting temperature materials like polymers. Commonly used tin-silver-copper (Sn-Ag-Cu) solder alloys, which require high-processing temperatures (>240˚C), can cause significant thermal warpage due to the differences in thermal expansion coefficients of these materials.
To tackle this issue, employing low melting point solder alloys such as tin-indium (Sn-In) and tin-bismuth (Sn-Bi) is an effective solution because it allows for a reduction in reflow temperature.
“Reducing the overall size of a device also affects the solder properties and ultimately the reliability of the device,” Luktuke says. “For example, the smaller size of solder joints means that they will carry higher current densities. This can lead to high heat buildup in the package due to Joule heating. Moreover, the solders are also prone to electromigration damage.”
To form an electrical connection between the components, the solder alloys are melted and solidified. Luktuke’s research focuses on understanding how this solidification process influences the formation of microstructures in these solder alloys. These microstructures affect the mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of the joints. Therefore, it is critical to understand the mechanisms behind their formations.
He says most of the previous studies have been limited to analyzing the 2D images of the solidified structures using traditional electron microscopy methods.
“This limits our knowledge of the shapes, sizes and distribution of microstructural features such as phases that form during solidification. The use of advanced X-ray imaging techniques, such as synchrotron X-ray tomography, at Argonne National Laboratory offers a distinctive approach to nondestructively assess the 3D microstructure,” Luktuke says.
“Moreover, it enables rapid capture of changes occurring during solidification, thereby enhancing our analysis to a four-dimensional perspective (3D microstructure over solidification time),” he adds. “However, such 4D experiments on high-density solder alloys such as tin-bismuth are extremely difficult due to various experimental challenges. During my PhD, we successfully conducted the 4D investigation of solidification process at ANL.”
Luktuke says that for the first time, he observed a unique pyramidal morphology of Bi forming in the solder alloy. This experimental methodology developed in this work has the potential to be extended to investigate a wide range of alloy solidification mechanisms, enabling a deeper understanding of these materials.
“The nondestructive X-ray tomography characterization allowed us to visualize, for the first time, the precise pyramidal morphology of Bi particles. With our 4D-solidification study, we were able to identify the fundamental mechanisms behind the formation of such pyramidal Bi particles,” Luktuke says.
“On the other hand, the experimental methodology we developed in conjunction with collaborators at 7-BM beamline at Argonne National Laboratory could be used to understand various alloy solidification mechanisms which hold important engineering applications.”","[{'summary_text': 'amey luktuke is a graduate research assistant in materials engineering at the university of california . he is working to understand the solidification behavior of new, lower temperature interconnects in electronic packaging .'}]"

Purdue’s microwave technology could lead to more stable vaccine supply chain,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight on the vaccine supply chain and public health impact of vaccine stability. But Purdue University researchers have been working on the problem for years — using rocket science to advance a freeze-drying technology that lengthens product shelf life. And that technology could soon be available in the marketplace.
A Purdue-led team has been awarded nearly $1 million to pursue a technology of using microwaves to make the freeze-drying process twice as fast and more cost-effective. Like astronaut ice cream, many vaccines are made stable for transport and storage through freeze-drying, also known as lyophilization.
“We want to push the technology further so that lifesaving treatments like COVID vaccines can easily reach every corner of the world,” said project leader Alina Alexeenko, senior associate dean for undergraduate education and academic programs at Purdue University in Indianapolis and professor of aeronautics and astronautics and chemical engineering in Purdue’s College of Engineering. “The conditions required for lyophilization are like those in outer space — it is a cold vacuum. We approach innovations in lyophilization equipment design and process the same way teams approach new spacecraft design. This time we’ve found a way to apply microwaves to get past some of the challenges the environment presents.”
Alexeenko is co-founder and co-director of LyoHUB, a university-industry center that brings together academic and industry researchers, representatives from government agencies, equipment manufacturers, and end-product users to improve freeze-drying technology to make food, pharmaceuticals and biotech products safer and more affordable.
The standard freeze-drying process is very expensive, but Alexeenko said the new technology could be much more cost-efficient, with the potential for an immediate impact on lives and the worldwide supply chain.
Merck and IMA Life North America Inc. have partnered with Purdue on the microwave project, which is funded by The National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL).
Merck is providing vaccine samples and leading development of benchmarks to compare the conventional and microwave lyophilization. IMA Life will lead integration of the new technology with the entire manufacturing process for sterile pharmaceuticals and vaccines.
“This microwave technology promises to not only provide uniformity to the drug product but also accelerate the freeze-drying process,” said Ernesto Renzi, president of sales and marketing at IMA Life North America.
In addition to Alexeenko, the research team at Purdue includes Eric Munson, the Dane O. Kildsig Chair and head of the Department of Industrial and Physical Pharmacy; Vivek Narsimhan, the Michael Ott Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering; Dimitrios Peroulis, the Reilly Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and senior vice president for Purdue University Online; and Qi (Tony) Zhou, associate professor of industrial and physical pharmacy.
“This is a significant advancement of a technology that can have an immediate impact on lives and the U.S. supply chain,” said Karen Plaut, Purdue University’s executive vice president of research. “Centers like LyoHUB are a great example of how we draw upon Purdue’s deep research strengths and state-of-the-art facilities, such as Birck Nanotechnology Center, and leverage the expertise of industry and government to improve our world.”
Alexeenko’s startup, LyoWave, is working with Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization to bring this technology to the marketplace.
“This is yet another example of a Purdue innovation that can make an impact on the world,” said Purdue Innovates senior vice president Brooke Beier. “Purdue Innovates is focused on results: transforming research into intellectual property that can be licensed to startups and industries and, finally, products that can save lives.”
LyoHUB (http://www.lyohub.org), a university-industry center at Purdue University, is advancing the science and technology of lyophilization in order to lower costs and improve the availability of lyophilized products. Though time-consuming and inefficient in its current state, lyophilization is a critical manufacturing process for the pharmaceutical industry. It is used in about 25% of new injectable drugs, vaccines and biological products. The need for advancements in this area is magnified as COVID-19 lyophilized treatments, such as Gilead’s remdesivir, diagnostic reagents and other countermeasures are being developed and evaluated.
In addition to enhancing vaccines, biopharmaceuticals and diagnostics, lyophilization is used in food products. It is a $30 billion-dollar part of the food and pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.
LyoHUB was founded in 2014 with two member companies. Since then, it has grown to include 32 members. In 2017, it led the creation of the first lyophilization technology road map, which included more than 100 contributors from organizations across academic, industry and government institutions. LyoHUB also developed the first recognized consensus standard in lyophilization instrumentation issued by ASTM in 2021. The LyoHUB tech demo facility is located in the Birck Nanotechnology Center at Discovery Park District at Purdue.
The Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization operates one of the most comprehensive technology transfer programs among leading research universities in the U.S. Services provided by this office support the economic development initiatives of Purdue University and benefit the university’s academic activities through commercializing, licensing and protecting Purdue intellectual property.

National Grief Awareness Day recognized annually on Aug. 30,"summarize:National Grief Awareness Day takes place annually on Aug. 30. Founded by Angie Cartwright in 2014, the day’s goal is to help raise awareness about grief and loss, help people move toward healing and closure, encourage individuals to talk about the topic, and serve as reminder that grief comes in many forms and affects everyone differently.
Mental Health America (MHA) states that loss of a loved one is one of life’s most stressful events and can cause a significant emotional crisis. According to MHA, there is no standard process for grief, but there are many different emotions that can take place, including:
Anger
Denial
Disbelief
Guilt
Sadness
Shock
Yearning
Coping with grief is vital to an individual’s mental health, and even though some may reference the “stages of grief,” there is no real guide to mourning.
Psychologists call the persistent, destructive grief that can follow an especially painful loss “complicated grief.” Yale psychologist Holly Prigerson has estimated that 15% of people who have lost a loved one reach this emotional low point.
Grieving is also a form of illness, according to many studies. In some cases, it may be as debilitating as a physical illness. Many who experience grief feel numb, exhausted, disorganized and confused during the grieving process. Studies have linked to grief to physical pain and illness. One example includes:
Grief Can Be Heartbreaking for People Battling Heart Failure
Many articles and other resources are available to assist individuals with grief. For example, SupportLinc, provider of behavioral health services for Purdue’s West Lafayette campus, has several online resources, including:
Flash Course: Coping with Grief
Grief and Stress – article
Grief, Bereavement and Coping With Loss of a Loved One From Cancer – article
Understanding Cumulative Grief – article

A Purdue University research team has revealed complex new details about the function of a key protein shared by mammals, including humans. Many cancers result when this DNA methyltransferase protein goes awry.
The findings, from a study led by a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student, also include contributions by five undergraduate students and appeared in the journal Cell Reports. The results show, for the first time, the mechanism by which a specific type of RNA regulates the expression of a critical DNA methyltransferase gene, Dnmt3b.
“Regulation of DNA methylation is at the heart of many diseases,” said Humaira Gowher, associate professor of biochemistry. But under normal conditions, DNA methylation, catalyzed by Dnmt3b, plays an important role in how young, unformed mammalian cells divide and develop into more specialized cells. DNA methylation also regulates the epigenetics process that bypasses genetic coding in transmitting selected traits to mammals’ offspring.
“We show in this paper how the DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt3b, is precisely and restrictively expressed during early development and then shut off,” Gowher said.
A malfunction in Dnmt3b has a potential bearing on cancer cell behavior. That’s because certain conditions cause abnormal DNA methylation. And changes in DNA methylation have become critical biomarkers for cancer detection, she noted.
In a long, careful and varied series of experiments, Gowher’s team tracked the location and timing of Dnmt3b expression to determine the mechanism that controls it by using mouse embryonic stem cells as a developmental model. Stem cells, found only in early-stage embryos, can develop into any other type of cell found in the body.
The experiments revealed an interplay of several regulatory molecules. The team discovered that after the noncoding RNA creates an open environment at the gene promoter, where all action starts, it also delivers the splicing protein hnRNPL to the gene-transcribing locomotive, RNA Pol II. The latter gives a ride to the hitchhiking splicing protein to its molecular workplace, which is farther away from the promoter in the gene body.
“The noncoding RNAs have the ability to bind splice factors. They can bring this splicing factor to the RNA polymerase at the promoter, and the polymerase will give it a ride,” Gowher said.
The results helped show that two genetic processes — transcription and alternative splicing — serve as dual controls in fine-tuning the different forms of Dnmt3b, said Mohd Saleem Dar, lead author of the Cell Reports paper. In transcription, RNA copies a DNA sequence to aid cellular protein production. And through alternative splicing, a gene can combine hundreds of DNA sequences to make proteins in different ways.
“When I differentiated these naive mouse embryonic stem cells and checked the expression of the Dnmt3b, I saw that it’s induced,” said Dar, now a staff scientist at the National Institutes of Health. In its induced state, Dnmt3b triggers cellular development. “And with that induction, we saw splicing,” he said.
Dar also explored the relationship between alternative splicing and the expression state of Dnmt3b.
“You need to show the full picture of the Dnmt3b alternative splicing during its low and high expression states,” Gowher said. When Dar looked at the alternative splicing of the low expressed state, he noticed that alternative splicing choice resulted in Dnmt3b protein, which has no enzymatic activity. However, at a high expression state, the alternative splicing switched, resulting in the expression of the enzymatically active protein.
“This mechanism could have multiple functions, including preventing impaired development due to spurious DNA methylation at an early stage,” she said.
The study showed that in embryonic stem cells, Dnmt3bas delivers proteins that keep the Dnmt3b gene promoter in a “primed” state to receive activation signals during differentiation. At the activated promoter, Dnmt3bas also delivers splicing proteins that bind to the Pol II, thus coordinating gene expression with alternative splicing.
The five undergraduate co-authors were recent graduates Hannah Whitlock and Nina Bippus, along with Madison Ceminsky, Martin Emerson and Hern Tan. They provided valuable help to Dar and co-authors Isaiah Mensah and Sarah McGovern, who are both biochemistry graduate students.
Additional co-authors included research associate Ming He; Ikjot Singh Sohal, a postdoctoral research associate at Purdue’s Institute for Cancer Research; and Mark Hall, associate professor of biochemistry.

Purdue research: Ice caps on Mars may reveal planet’s climate history,"summarize:A team of scientists, led by Purdue University’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences professors Ali Bramson and Michael Sori, set out to unlock the hidden, historic secrets within ice caps on Mars and published their findings in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, 2023
Much like the Earth’s, Mars’ poles are cold and icy. The Martian ice caps have neighboring craters, formed from impacts by meteors, like the craters you might see on Earth’s moon. Near the poles, many of these craters are filled with ice. How did that ice get there? Was it all deposited at the same time? These questions are what a team of scientists working with Professors Bramson and Sori at Purdue University’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences have set out to answer. They use radar data collected by a spacecraft orbiting Mars to unlock these icy time capsules’ hidden, historic secrets.
Mars has two large ice caps at its poles, which combined contain a similar volume of ice as Greenland on Earth. Near these large ice caps are craters that are filled with ice, referred to as outlying crater ice deposits. These outlying crater ice deposits may or may not have formed at the same time as the polar caps. Just as scientists on Earth use ice cores to analyze how our climate has changed over time, radar observations of ice on Mars can penetrate deep into the ice and act as digital ice cores, recording changes to the ice deposited over time. Purdue researchers use these radar observations to analyze the history of the outlying crater deposits and find that the northern deposits may have had a similar history to the north polar cap, while the southern deposits may have a more varied history.","[{'summary_text': 'a team of scientists, led by Purdue University’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, set out to unlock the hidden, historic secrets within ice caps on Mars . the researchers used radar data collected by a spacecraft orbiting Mars to unlock these icy time capsules’ hidden secrets .'}]"

"Purdue University, U.S. Naval Test Pilot School to partner on joint graduate degree program","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University and the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School have signed an educational partnership agreement designed to enable USNTPS students to earn Purdue graduate degrees online with credit for their USNTPS training.
Under the agreement, the plan is to develop a curriculum pathway utilizing a number of courses in the intensive, 48-week curriculum taken by students at USNTPS to count toward Purdue graduate degrees, with the students also taking advantage of online courses from Purdue’s College of Engineering and the Purdue Polytechnic Institute to complete their degrees.
USNTPS, located onboard Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River in Maryland, is part of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) and the Naval Test Wing Atlantic. USNTPS trains Navy test pilots, flight officers, engineers, and industry and foreign partners in a full spectrum of test and evaluation techniques for aircraft and aircraft systems. The school is at the forefront in development of, and leads aviation in, standardization of modern flight testing. It is the only domestic source of rotary wing test pilots and serves as the dedicated rotary wing test pilot school of the U.S. Army. Its highly competitive program also has graduated more than 90 NASA astronauts to date.
“This is an incredible opportunity for both Purdue and NAWCAD, the Wing, and TPS,” said Capt. Elizabeth Somerville, commander, Naval Test Wing Atlantic. “It’s a win-win for all parties. The speed in which this effort is moving is a testament to how eager we all are to bring higher education excellence to TPS and NAWCAD personnel.”
To start, the partnership would involve Purdue online master’s degrees in engineering technology and interdisciplinary engineering, and include Purdue’s online Doctor of Technology degree for personnel who already have earned a master’s. The 100% online interdisciplinary Master of Science in Engineering (MSE/MS) is a unique and flexible engineering program from Purdue’s College of Engineering, which U.S. News & World Report ranks No. 2 in the nation for online graduate programs. The 100% online engineering technology degree is a synergistic combination of Purdue’s electrical and computer engineering technology, industrial engineering technology, manufacturing engineering technology, and mechanical engineering technology programs.
The agreement also has the potential for pathways to make some of the courses from the USNTPS curriculum available to Purdue engineering and Purdue Polytechnic students.
In addition, this partnership presents possibilities for broader research collaborations with potential areas of collaboration in artificial intelligence, unmanned and autonomous aerial systems, hypersonics and sustainable energy solutions.

"Prestigious civil engineering programs continue global mission in building, advancing legacy of excellence, storied tradition","summarize:From responding as experts to major earthquakes and wildfires to designing modern marvels such as the Golden Gate Bridge, studying space habitats for NASA and innovating “smart concrete” to communicate when roads need repairs, Purdue University’s undergraduate and graduate civil engineering programs consistently rank among the nation’s best, built on more than 130 years of outstanding teaching and research.
And 2023 was no exception.
Purdue’s Christopher B. and Susan S. Burke Graduate Program in Civil Engineering and the Lyles School of Civil Engineering for undergraduates each ranked No. 7 overall in the 2023 U.S. News & World Report surveys. Both have extended their run as top 10 programs for over a decade. Rankings in the U.S News & World Report surveys are computed from the responses to a survey sent to deans, heads and selected senior faculty.
“The efforts and accomplishments achieved by our incredible undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends are what make the Lyles School of Civil Engineering and the Christopher B. and Susan S. Burke Graduate Program in Civil Engineering such strong programs,” says Rao S. Govindaraju, Bowen Engineering Head of Civil Engineering and Christopher B. and Susan S. Burke Distinguished Professor of Civil Engineering. “I am proud of what they have done and look forward to what the future has in store for our school.”
A who’s who of the world’s leading and most historic civil engineers reveals direct ties to the storied civil engineering program, which was established in 1887 and is one of the oldest colleges at Purdue. For example:
Purdue’s first Black graduate was David Robert Lewis, an 1894 civil engineering graduate whose senior thesis, “Highway Road Construction,” was ahead of its time.
Longtime civil engineering professor Charles Alton Ellis was chiefly responsible for the structural design of the Golden Gate Bridge.
Solomon Cady Hollister, a former Purdue civil engineering professor who went on to become dean of the College of Engineering at Cornell University, in the 1930s designed the conduits that carry water into the turbines of Hoover Dam.
Elwood Mead, an 1884 Purdue agriculture alum, was commissioner of the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation in the 1920s and became the chief engineer for Hoover Dam’s construction. The dam’s Lake Mead, the world’s largest manmade reservoir, bears his name.
CE alum Stephen D. Bechtel Jr., patriarch of the Bechtel family and third-generation CEO of Bechtel Corp., was a global figure in business, public affairs and philanthropy, overseeing the company’s growth into a world leader on six continents.
Prominent civil engineering professors Gerald Leonards, a Purdue alum, and Milton Harr led extensive research on earthwork and foundation projects in the 1990s, particularly the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Harr was a University of Rome research committee member studying the medieval structure, and Leonards was the only non-European to sit on an official government commission in Italy to investigate how to stabilize the iconic tower.
That global impact remains a cornerstone of the program today, with Purdue’s expertise regularly playing out in connection with major events.
Within days of the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria in February, civil engineering professor Ayhan Irfanoglu traveled to the disaster zone with a team of structural engineers to assess the damage.
Andrew Whelton, a professor of civil engineering and environmental and ecological engineering, has responded to wildfires and toxic spills with his students the past four years to determine their impact on water systems. Whelton is headed to Hawaii to help assess any evidence of water contamination in the public utilities from the deadly wildfire that ravaged the Maui community of Lahaina.
“The faster we can decontaminate water systems, the faster communities can recover economically,” Whelton says.

Purdue’s global reputation as a leader in earthquake engineering was a major draw to Jeffrey Dowgala when he was deciding where to pursue his PhD. While completing undergrad and graduate studies at Drexel University, he collaborated with Irfanoglu and learned about Purdue’s extensive civil engineering program, opportunities and research facilities.
“While Purdue’s civil engineering program has strong academic fundamentals, my professors went beyond teaching out of a book and taught us to critically think about and understand the tools available and the engineering problems we were trying to solve,” says Dowgala, a CE alum who is now a senior associate at global engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates in Emeryville, California.
“Only then could we understand what combinations of methods or techniques are appropriate — or not appropriate — to solve the problem.”","[{'summary_text': ""a who's who of the world's leading and most historic civil engineers reveals direct ties to the storied civil engineering program . a 95% job placement rate ensures students get the chance to use their skills developed at Purdue to make a difference in the world .""}]"

Student loan repayments to restart soon,"summarize:Purdue employees and any former students with outstanding student loan debt should be preparing for the restart of federal student loan payments. After a three-year COVID-19 payment pause, student loans will begin accruing interest on Sept. 1, and payments will resume on Oct. 1.
Several changes occurred during the payment pause, and borrowers should ready themselves. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says roughly 44% of borrowers now have a different loan servicer than before the pandemic. It is extremely important that borrowers update their contact information with Federal Student Aid (FSA) by logging in with their FSA-ID, or by calling the FSA Information Center at 800-433-3243. Borrowers should also re-establish communications with their loan servicer.
FSA has developed resources to direct borrowers who will be restarting payments after the payment pause and to help borrowers about to start repaying loans for the first time.  Borrowers with loans already in default may wish to learn about the Fresh Start for loans in default program.
Borrowers should be prepared for a long wait when contacting their loan servicers as there will be many other people contacting those resources. Everyone should also think about setting goals for repayment, consider creating a loan payment budget, and be on the lookout for scams.  FSA and the borrower’s specific loan servicer should be the main points of contact for loan repayment information.","[{'summary_text': 'after a three-year COVID-19 payment pause, student loans will begin accruing interest on Sept. 1, and payments will resume on Oct. 1 . roughly 44% of borrowers now have a different loan servicer than before the pandemic .'}]"

Purdue announces new Dean of the College of Science and other leadership updates,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
With the Fall 2023 semester set to start Monday (Aug. 21), Purdue University has announced several personnel updates to its leadership team.
Earlier this summer, new deans were announced for the College of Agriculture and the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business (DSB).
Bernie Engel was selected after a national search as the next Glenn W. Sample Dean of Agriculture, effective July 15. He served Purdue as senior associate dean of agricultural research and graduate education in the College of Agriculture for the past four years, driving graduate student enrollment, scholarly impact and intellectual innovation across the college. Engel earned his PhD in agricultural engineering from Purdue and joined the faculty in 1988.
James “Jim” Bullard was chosen after a national search to lead the continued transformation of the reimagined DSB and started as its inaugural dean on Tuesday (Aug. 15). The longest serving sitting president of Federal Reserve Banks – spending the last 15 years with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis – Bullard is one of the nation’s foremost economists and respected scholar-leaders. His scholarly impact has been based on research-based thinking and intellectual openness to new theories and explanations.
Following a national search, Lucy Flesch has been selected the next Frederick L. Hovde Dean of the College of Science. She succeeds Patrick Wolfe, who was appointed in January as provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity. Jean Chmielewski, the Alice Watson Kramer Distinguished Professor of Chemistry in the College of Science, served as interim dean.
Wolfe thanked the search advisory committee, led by chair Richard Kuhn, the Trent and Judith Anderson Distinguished Professor in Science and the Krenicki Family Director of the Purdue Institute of Inflammation, Immunology and Infectious Disease, for its work in reviewing candidates, organizing forums for the finalists and gathering campus feedback on the candidates. The committee narrowed the field to six finalists, all highly qualified and outstanding individuals.
Flesch is currently the senior associate dean for faculty affairs in the College of Science and has served in that leadership position for the past five years. She received the American Geophysical Union’s 2022 Paul G. Silver Award for Outstanding Scientific Service, recognized by the global geology and geophysics community for her tremendous personal dedication and leadership for geodetic, seismic and tectonophysics research initiatives. Her research focuses on understanding how relative tectonic plate motions are accommodated throughout diffusely deforming continental regions where plate tectonic theory breaks down and quantifying the forces involved in driving this deformation.
Flesch joined the Purdue faculty in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences in 2005 and has been a full professor since 2016.
After a national search, Andrew Mesecar, a Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry and the Walther Professor in Cancer Structural Biology, has been named director of the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research (PICR) after serving as its interim director since August 2022, during which the former center transitioned to an institute.
Mesecar had earlier served as deputy director for the cancer center beginning in 2010 and was department head of biochemistry. He is a leader in basic research on the structure and function of enzymes involved in disease, as well as targeting these enzymes with drugs using structure-based design approaches.
The PICR is among the nation’s leading institutions in cancer-related drug development. The institute’s scientists currently are developing 26 immunotherapies and 37 drugs, including 11 in human clinical trials.
Steve Schultz has been promoted to senior vice president and general counsel. As Purdue’s chief legal officer, he advises the board of trustees, the president and senior administrators on issues of law, governance and risk management and oversees representation of the university in all legal matters. In addition to developing and leading its internal legal operation since joining Purdue in 2013, Schultz was one of the architects of the Boiler Gold Rush free speech orientation module, which he still moderates each year. Schultz received an undergraduate degree in history and political science from Butler University and law degrees from Yale University and the University of Cambridge (Trinity Hall).
Adrian Allen has been promoted to vice president and deputy general counsel. His primary areas of concentration are construction law, procurement issues, litigation and contract matters, in addition to providing legal and governance support for university financing. Allen, who joined Purdue in 2014, received his JD from Indiana University.
In addition, Monica Bloom has been promoted to associate vice president and senior counsel, human resources and academic affairs, and Jonas Burgett has been promoted to associate vice president and senior counsel, university partnerships and digital education.
Since its inception a decade ago, the Office of Legal Counsel has become an integral component of the Purdue ecosystem, providing essential support to the university’s strategic initiatives while also helping navigate the complex maze of legal and regulatory requirements that apply to its wide-ranging operations. For more than 10 years, Purdue’s in-house attorneys have served as trusted advisors not only to the Board of Trustees, administrators, faculty and staff, but also to the management teams of affiliated organizations such as Purdue Research Foundation, Purdue Global and Purdue Applied Research Institute. The additional title designations announced today reflect the leadership roles played by these attorneys within the university and are consistent with the practices of peer legal offices.
David Reingold has been appointed senior vice president for policy planning, while continuing his current role as the Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts.
In his new role, Reingold will report to the president, and will coordinate various stakeholders for Purdue@DC, lead the systemwide civics literacy and freedom of inquiry initiatives, and oversee the longitudinal study on students’ critical thinking that was piloted five years ago.
As Dean of Liberal Arts, Reingold launched Cornerstone Integrated Liberal Arts, reimagining general education at Purdue. Cornerstone is now being replicated at 60-plus institutions nationally through a National Endowment for the Humanities program. Other key initiatives of his administration include Degree+, which allows students to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree along with their Bachelor of Science degree and complete both in four years; advancing Purdue’s commitment to affordability with the initial Degree in 3 program; Empowering Excellence, a broad program to support faculty research; and a graduate student initiative, which provides a better balance between research and teaching, redistributes resources to allow for more competitive stipends, and better prepares graduate students for professional success.
Julie Rosa has been promoted to vice president for communications. Reporting to Ethan Braden, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Purdue University and Purdue Global, Rosa is a member of the leadership team for Purdue Marketing and Communications. She most recently served as associate vice president for communications and has worked at Purdue in a variety of communications roles since 1993. As vice president for communications, she will continue to lead the teams responsible for media relations, crisis and issues communications, internal and executive communications, working closely with marketing and communications colleagues across the Purdue system and external to the university to position, promote and protect Purdue.
John Gipson has been promoted to the provost’s chief of staff and assistant vice provost for academic operations. In this role, he will serve as a principal aide and advisor to Provost Patrick Wolfe while collaborating with his leadership team, university senior leadership, deans, faculty leaders, directors and others to pursue and support Purdue’s priorities and objectives.
Gipson most recently served as assistant vice provost for innovative educational pathways, following five-plus years as executive director and director of Summer Session, where summer undergraduate enrollment grew by 57.4% under his leadership. Summer Start has served more than 1,000 students, many from underserved backgrounds, and the program received the John N. Gardner Institutional Excellence for Students in Transition Award from the National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition in 2020. Gipson also led implementation efforts for the new Winter Session.

CBF Forensics launches VR crime scene training programs and THC quantification system,"summarize:HAMMOND, Ind. —
CBF Forensics, a northwest Indiana forensic and education startup, has launched two new products: virtual reality (VR) programming for forensic crime scene training and a system to quantify the amount of THC in manufactured CBD and hemp products.
Crime by the F.I.V.E.S. provides training scenarios that simulate live scenes using VR technology.
Charles Steele is the founder and president of CBF Forensics. He said the Crime by the F.I.V.E.S. VR crime scene training program brings the latest technology and methods to forensic science classrooms and law enforcement agencies, providing affordable and standardized training.
“Crime scene investigation training is inconsistent across the country; there is currently no national standard. Most initial training takes the form of mock crime scenes that are not governed by global standards or requirements,” said Steele, who also is a lecturer of forensic science and the forensic science coordinator at Purdue University Northwest (PNW). “The professional training that does exist is out of the economic range for most law enforcement agencies and is completely unavailable for most educational institutions.
“In addition, it is common for agencies to become entrenched in existing methods and not be aware of the latest technology,” Steele said. “As a result, practitioners and new students often learn and use outdated methods.”
The Crime by the F.I.V.E.S. VR training program connects to in-person, real-world laboratory exercises that can be used to fill out a full semester course.
“This educational approach allows the latest methods to be economically passed on to the general practitioner,” Steele said. “Where possible, CBF Forensics will provide the latest support chemistry and devices to complement these scenarios.”
Crime by the F.I.V.E.S. will be accessible through school and private learning management systems. Steele said it improves upon other VR crime scene training tools on the market by providing better features and functionality.
“The simulations follow real physics; if a user bumps into an item, it will move and possibly corrupt the crime scene. The visibility of evidence matches real-world optics,” Steele said. “Crime by the F.I.V.E.S. is just the first in what will be a series of crime scene training scenarios. The original program was built by CIVS, the Center for Innovation through Visualization and Simulation, at PNW. CIVS is a leader in the simulation field, and our relationship will allow CBF Forensics to continue to produce the highest-quality products.”
Along with Crime by the F.I.V.E.S., CBF Forensics will offer additional forensics products for fingerprinting and blood detection applications. Steele said those products will be launched later in 2023.
CBF Forensics also has created QuanTHC, a system that enables CBD and hemp manufacturers to measure the amount of THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, in their products. THC is the main psychoactive compound in marijuana.
Steele said CBD products must be free of THC, and hemp products cannot be above certain THC levels. He said up to 70% of CBD products sold in northwest Indiana contain THC, and hemp products are not monitored, which puts manufacturers and consumers at risk of legal and financial consequences.
“Innocently purchased hemp products may violate local laws,” Steele said. “Users of CBD products may face criminal charges for having THC in their blood and lose their jobs and military careers, etc. The manufacturers face civil liability for the harm done to their customers.”
Steele said most boutique manufacturers have no viable way to test the quantity of THC in their CBD and hemp products.
“QuanTHC provides an easy-to-use quantification test that does not require expensive analytical equipment or extensive chemical training,” Steele said. “It offers accurate quantification levels, which improves upon traditional tests that have only yes-no indicators.”
By 2024, CBF Forensics will pair QuanTHC with a benchtop neutralizer that disposes of all the test chemicals used in the quantifications.
A marketing video about Crime by the F.I.V.E.S. and QuanTHC is available on YouTube.
CBF Forensics licenses its technologies, developed by Steele and collaborators, through the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization. CBF Forensics is the first startup launched from Purdue Northwest through the Purdue Innovates office. Purdue University Northwest, serving northwest Indiana, offers more than 70 bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degree programs to nearly 9,000 students.
CBF Forensics has received support from PNW’s College of Engineering and Sciences and the Center for Innovation through Visualization and Simulation, student research groups at Purdue Northwest’s chemistry and physics department, and student Capstone Plus teams at the Purdue Polytechnic Institute at the West Lafayette campus.
“These student teams are a valuable resource,” Steele said. “Startup companies like ours do not have the resources of a fully staffed R&D laboratory.”
Steele is especially grateful to Kenneth C. (Chris) Holford, Purdue Northwest’s provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs, whose office provided the initial funding to bring the forensic research at PNW and state-of-the-art VR training at CIVS together.
“The launch of CBF Forensics highlights the impact that Purdue Northwest can have in working with entrepreneurs to advance research that leads toward product commercialization,” Holford said. “I believe that commercialization of research products in partnership with the university through entities like the new PNW Impact Lab will play an increasingly important role in future regional economic development.”
CBF Forensics also received support from Purdue’s Technical Assistance Program, or TAP40, and Purdue’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Steele said he is grateful to have worked with the people and university resources.
“Going through the process of starting the company, we have worked with dozens of students and faculty across three campuses within the Purdue system,” Steele said. “We have also worked with business and science professionals through Purdue Research Foundation and the University of Illinois Chicago’s forensic science program. We are excited to be open for business.”
CBF Forensics (CBF) is unique in its capabilities and product offerings. We integrate innovative software, chemistry and devices for forensic science and higher education as well as adjacent industries. Our namesake product Crime by the F.I.V.E.S. is a first-of-its-kind nonscripted, data-driven virtual reality (VR) crime scene investigation training package that teaches the standards of crime scene investigation and introduces new technologies. No other VR company has our expertise in forensic science. Between Charles A. Steele and Dr. A. Karl Larsen, we have more than 70 years of combined forensic expertise. Both have run professional laboratories and forensic science academic programs.

Purdue Global to offer new Military Physician Assistant Preparation concentration,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The U.S. armed forces is known for its frontline soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and Guardians. Behind the scenes, medical personnel are critical to keep those service members healthy, and upskilling personnel for positions such as physician assistants in medical units is essential.
To help address that need, Purdue Global has launched a new military physician assistant pathway, thanks in part to feedback from active-duty service members.
The new Military Physician Assistant Preparation (MPAP) concentration will be offered through Purdue Global’s Bachelor of Science in health science degree program.
Purdue Global expands opportunities through Community College of the Air Force program
‘This is a comeback that’s really mine.’
Purdue Global chancellor highlights growth initiatives, student success
“There is a large demand for physician assistants in the military, and it was one of our most frequently requested programs when we surveyed service members who were working on degrees,” said Richard Orona, who serves as Purdue Global’s director and a professor of military health and nursing. “Military physician assistants (PA) could transition to the private sector after one’s military service is complete. The military PA credentials are civilian-equivalent, and we know there is a need for physician assistants in the nonmilitary market, such as in physicians’ offices and hospitals.”
The concentration includes the academic prerequisites needed before one can be accepted to the military’s Interservice Physician Assistant Program (IPAP). Completion of the MPAP concentration serves as a preparation for, and not a direct qualification for, the IPAP offered by the U.S. military.
Enrollment in the MPAP concentration is limited to active-duty U.S. military Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Space Force, Reservists and National Guard service members. If a student is not accepted to IPAP, they can complete their studies at Purdue Global for a Bachelor of Science in health science and apply to civilian PA schools.
Completion of the MPAP concentration does not guarantee admission to the IPAP, and the military may change IPAP prerequisites.
“We have made it easy for the service members to be in this program. The popularity is off the charts,” Orona said. “Purdue Global is happy to help service members achieve their educational dreams and missions.”
Orona and Rebecca Zolotor, interim dean of Purdue Global’s School of Health Sciences, were recent guests on the “Your Next Mission” podcast, where they talked about the MPAP concentration and other degree programs.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online school for working adults. Purdue Global proudly serves approximately 10,000 military-affiliated students, which include uniformed personnel, veterans and eligible dependents.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey. Purdue Global is a nonprofit, public university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and backed by Purdue University. For more information, visit https://stories.purdue.edu/purdue-global/.

Q&A with Internet founders Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn ahead of upcoming Presidential Lecture Series,"summarize:Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, the researchers credited with the seminal work during the 1970s that led to the creation of the Internet a half-century ago, will join Purdue University President Mung Chiang for a Presidential Lecture Series event at 6 p.m. Sept. 7 in Stewart Center’s Fowler Hall.
The Presidential Lecture, which is free and open to the public, coincides with the 60th anniversary celebration of Purdue’s historic launch of the nation’s first academic computer science department and the 50th anniversary of the Internet’s launch in January 1983. The Cerf-Kahn event is titled “Origins of the Internet and Its Subsequent Evolution.” Tickets are required. Go here for ticketing information. The full fall Presidential Lecture series schedule is available here.
Cerf and Kahn led the design and implementation of what formed the basis of the Internet, beginning with their groundbreaking research paper during the mid-1970s. Titled “A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication,” the paper was subsequently published in the IEEE Transactions on Communications in May 1974 and outlined the resulting Internet architecture for the technological innovation that’s ubiquitous today. They coined the concept of “internetting” in discussing how to interconnect networks.
Sixty years ago, Purdue celebrated the launch of its groundbreaking computer science program when it dedicated its new high-speed IBM 7090 digital computer. Today, Purdue’s computer science program is the largest and most selective undergraduate major on campus, with 2,207 undergraduate and 496 graduate students enrolled as of Fall 2022.
Together, Cerf and Kahn graciously answered a few questions posed to them in advance of their upcoming conversation on the Purdue campus with President Chiang.
Q: Why did you say yes to President Mung’s invitation to come to Purdue University as part of our first Presidential Lecture Series event in the 2023-24 academic year?
Cerf and Kahn: First, it is fortuitous that the invitation to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the original work on the Internet arrived about the time of year we actually presented our ideas to a group that met in September 1973 at the University of Sussex. That material was the basis for an IEEE paper that we wrote, which was published in May 1974. It described the overall architecture and protocols for what became the Internet. It also was the starting point for detailed protocol design work that began in January 1974 at Stanford with a group of Vint’s graduate students. Second, because the work was so focused on computer communication, it seemed to us similarly fortuitous that Purdue established the first computer science department in the U.S. in October 1962.
Q: Fifty years removed from the collaborations that set in motion your seminal breakthrough leading to the creation of the Internet, how do you put into words how history has viewed your achievement in an innovation that has become so integral and indispensable to our everyday lives today?
Cerf and Kahn: We have been showered with awards, but both of us are very cognizant that many hands have contributed to the work both before our involvement and subsequent to the operational rollout of the system in early 1983. The ability of this design to accommodate new ideas from many sources, to expand in scale by six or more orders of magnitude, and to incite continued innovation was perhaps the most satisfying aspect. The arrival of the World Wide Web in 1991 and the smartphone in 2007, both of which have become integral elements of the Internet of 2023, reinforces the notion that the design has empowered many to contribute and for the system to thrive. While the enabling power of the Internet also has amplified some harmful behaviors that need to be contained, on balance, the positives strongly outweigh the negatives. We are both persuaded that accountability must become a more integral part of the governance of the system, and that is going to require international cooperation.
Q: Looking back on your impressive careers, what is one thing you would tell your undergraduate college selves that might be meaningful to them and, perhaps, would resonate with our many Purdue students who will be sitting in the PLS audience for your lecture?
Cerf and Kahn: First lesson: If you want to do something big, get help! Preferably from people who are smarter than you are. An enormous amount of help has been provided by others in evolving the Internet from its origins to its present state. Many successful, independent commercial and academic initiatives have been launched, using the Internet as infrastructure and scaffolding.
Second lesson: As systems of this kind scale up, institutional elements become necessary and have been created as needed. Examples here include the Internet Architecture Board (IAB and its predecessors), the Internet Engineering and Research Taskforces (IETF, IRTF), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the DNS Root Server community, the Internet Governance Forum (and regional/national IGFs), the Regional Internet Registries (ARIN, RIPE-NCC, APNIC, LACNIC, AFRINIC), the original SRI-NIC, the ARPANET Internet Network Working Groups, the Request for Comments (RFCs) documentation series, and the list goes on.
Third lesson: Humility has been a friend in this endeavor — willingness to listen to others, empower them to explore and to change views at need. This has allowed so many new ideas to be tested and many to flourish.
Fourth lesson: Standardization has been a key to success. Many different standards organizations have contributed to the interoperability of so many components of today’s Internet. IETF, IEEE-SA, ITU-T, ISO, 3GPP, W3C and many others have produced standards that are used to make the Internet what it has become.
Finally, it is important to trust your instincts. Many people saw no future in computer networking back when most computers were still the large batch machines. Those who could envision a new environment of interactive computers — whether large time-sharing systems or even smaller desktops, laptops or handheld wireless devices — knew that networking had great potential if it could be made a reality. Financial help came early on from DARPA, which sponsored this effort over 50 years ago, but it was so important to just stay the course.

Staff & Student Bowling League to organize today,"summarize:The Purdue University Staff & Student Bowling League is inviting new members to join the league starting with fall semester Aug. 21. A callout and captains meeting is today (Aug. 14).
This is a relaxed mixed-gender league open to Purdue employees and their immediate families, Purdue students and spouses, and Purdue retirees. Bowling ability of participants varies, and the fun and social interaction of recreation is emphasized.
Bowling takes place 6:30-9 p.m. each Monday for 30 weeks, with breaks at holidays, and ends in late April. A team can have up to 10 members, and five bowl on any given night at Mike Aulby’s Arrowhead Bowl, 2331 Brothers Drive in Lafayette. Part-time bowlers are encouraged to join since some bowlers cannot bowl every week.
At the captains meeting at 6:30 p.m. today at the lanes, rosters will be set. New teams or unattached new bowlers should have someone there or at least should contact the league’s secretary and treasurer, Robert Cox, before then.
Cox can be reached at 765-494-9561 or cox@purdue.edu.
Cost is $25 for a year’s membership in the United States Bowling Congress and $15 for each night of bowling. More information can be found on the league’s website.
The league began in 1938-39 as a men’s employee league. It became a mixed league in 1989-90 and admitted students starting in 1998-99. Last year’s champion was Split Happens.","[{'summary_text': ""the league began in 1938-39 as a men's employee league . it became a mixed-gender league in 1989-90 and admitted students starting in 1998-99 .""}]"
Purdue all-hazards outdoor sirens test and evacuation drill scheduled for incoming students during Boiler Gold Rush,"summarize:The all-hazards outdoor emergency warning sirens will be tested on Aug. 17 as part of Boiler Gold Rush (BGR), the weeklong orientation program for incoming students. Students will also conduct an evacuation drill to practice how to properly respond in the event of an emergency.
Purdue’s warning sirens will be activated shortly before 11 a.m. The test will help students know what to listen for and what to do during a potential campus emergency. In an actual emergency, the sirens mean to immediately seek shelter (shelter in place) in the nearest building.
“Our emergency plan is simple,” said Jefferson Howells, director of Emergency Preparedness and Planning. “If you are outside and hear an all-hazards siren, go inside the nearest building. If you are inside and hear a fire alarm, go outside. Each major building has a building emergency plan to identify the shelter-in-place locations and the evacuation route to outside.”
The new students will also participate in an evacuation drill during BGR. Students will be guided to safely evacuate Elliott Hall of Music and several other buildings.
These drills will help inform incoming students of PurdueALERT, the university’s emergency warning notification system. As part of PurdueALERT, notifications may also be sent through text messages, Twitter (@purdueemergency), digital signs on campus, desktop pop-up alerts, Alertus beacons in classrooms, email, BoilerTV and local media. The Campus Emergency Status webpage will also be updated. All incoming students and others who are new to campus are encouraged to sign up for emergency text message notifications.
Emergency Preparedness and Planning is part of Administrative Operations. The organization supports the university by providing safe, reliable and transformative services. Providing important emergency preparedness resources for the campus community, and introducing those resources to new students, is just one of the ways the organization helps power Purdue.

Exposing the hidden genetic diversity of an ecologically harmful microbe,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A microscopic species of algae is causing toxic algal blooms around the world, affecting two dozen states in the U.S., especially Texas. New research into the genetic diversity of the responsible organism, Prymnesium parvum, could help authorities predict when blooms will occur.
Prymnesium blooms every winter in Texas, leading the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to monitor several lakes for signs of the next one. “When they bloom, they do more than kill fish. They disrupt whole ecosystems,” said Jennifer Wisecaver, associate professor of biochemistry at Purdue University.
Prymnesium, like many other single-celled organisms, along with all animals, plants and fungi, are eukaryotic organisms. Their cells all contain a nucleus. But Prymnesium are also classified as protists, meaning they are neither animal, plant nor fungi. And like plants, Prymnesium has chloroplasts to harness energy from the sun, which makes them algae.
The organism first bloomed in 1980 in the Pecos River. “Since then, Prymnesium has only gotten worse in Texas and its blooms have spread into nearby states,” Wisecaver said. Prymnesium has yet to plague Indiana waters, but it has appeared in northern states such as Nebraska, Iowa and West Virginia.
“They can’t grow in completely freshwater. They will die,” Wisecaver said. “But they are extremely tolerant of low salt levels and can survive in water with only 1% the salinity of typical seawater.”
What allows the organism to invade freshwater systems is among the questions Wisecaver’s lab is trying to answer. Last year, Prymnesium bloomed for the first time ever in Germany’s Oder River, whose waters have a low saline content.
“Prymnesium is a bit of a conundrum,” Wisecaver said. “It seems to bloom in suboptimal conditions for the species. It blooms in extremely low salinity and when nutrients aren’t very abundant.”
Current predictions of when toxic algal blooms will occur are based mainly on water conditions such as nutrients, salinity and temperature. But biological factors also could loom large.
“Different Prymnesium strains can make different types of toxins. Some strains are highly toxic, while others are less so. If we’re not accounting for these biological differences, that will affect our ability to predict when blooms will most likely occur and the effect that they’ll have on the environment. But before we can study the genes responsible for these differences, we first needed to sequence the genome of these organisms,” Wisecaver said. She and eight co-authors from Purdue, Penn State Harrisburg, University of California San Diego (UCSD) and Florida International University recently published their findings in the journal Current Biology.
At first, Wisecaver thought her group could sequence just one genome for Prymnesium parvum to act as a reference. “Prymnesium genomes are large, being the size of many plant or animal genomes,” Wisecaver said.
“Typically, it isn’t practical to sequence multiple genomes from a single species. Instead, we planned to compare the genetic composition of strains that differed in toxicity to one reference genome. However, we quickly discovered that there wasn’t just one genome to sequence. We needed to sequence many genomes to get a handle on the diversity that was present,” she said.
When examined under a microscope, all specimens of Prymnesium look alike. Yet the genomes of the single-celled Prymnesium strains in the new study contained from 115 million to 360 million DNA base pairs.
“That’s an incredible variation in genome size. Far too much to be considered a single species,” Wisecaver said. “Turns out that blooms of Prymnesium are not just one big population. They are multiple populations, multiple different species.”
Figuring out that one of the genomes under analysis was a hybrid proved to be another challenge. “Putting a genome together is like putting together a large, complex jigsaw puzzle,” Wisecaver said. “But imagine that we had two jigsaw puzzles mixed together. We thought we were working on one puzzle when we were actually dealing with two. That took extra analysis to figure out.”
“Despite the importance of algae, this work is only the second example of a genomic description of algal hybridization,” said Timothy Fallon, a National Institutes of Health National Research Service Award Postdoctoral Fellow at UCSD. “It sheds light on a whole mode of evolution that hasn’t been well considered because the tools and the road map for how to use them weren’t there. Now the tools exist, and through this work a new road map exists to use those tools to study hybridization.”
Fallon expects many more algal or protist researchers to discover hybridization cases in the organisms they study. “These hybridizations might be the key behind the evolutionary adaptations they are studying,” he said.
The new study shows the drawbacks of classifying single-celled eukaryotic organisms based on their physical form and structure. “That’s not sufficient for Prymnesium, and I expect that the same is true for other protists. We may be underestimating a lot of diversity in these groups,” Wisecaver said.
This research was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Science Foundation. Providing resources for some of the work was Purdue’s Rosen Center for Advanced Computing and the Flow Cytometry and Cell Separation Facility at Purdue’s Bindley Bioscience Center.
Study co-authors also include Purdue alumni Robert Auber (PhD ’22), Olivia Riedling (BS ’22) and postdoctoral scientist Amanda Pendleton.

PARI’s Global Development and Innovation begins $1.6M engineers program in Kenya,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue Applied Research Institute’s Global Development and Innovation division announces the start of a four-year, $1.6 million project called Jenga Engineers for Life, a collaboration with the Tumaini Innovation Center, a community-based organization in Eldoret, Kenya.
The Jenga project has been an eight-year collaboration between Purdue and Tumaini and is the very first award PARI-GDI will manage via Purdue. Funding comes through the U.S. Agency for International Development’s American Schools and Hospitals Abroad initiative.
The project will create an engineering innovation campus to accommodate about 300 Kenyan youths annually. It will include construction of solar-powered classrooms; a demonstration, training and virtual exchange space; dormitory and commons buildings; and workshops equipped for hands-on learning and manufacturing of engineering innovations.
From the Jenga project founding in 2015, Tumaini has sought to harness innovative, engineering-based teaching to transform the lives of Kenya’s street youth.
“I will call it a miracle, a very small initial investment of people and spirit in 10 years has grown to this,” said George Chiu, Purdue’s assistant dean for global engineering programs and partnerships, speaking at the project’s inauguration during Tumaini’s first graduation ceremony in June. Purdue’s Jennifer DeBoer, PARI-GDI director of practice for youth education, has led the effort as Jenga Engineers’ project director.
Tumaini has grown from eight to almost 100 students and recently expanded to accommodate both genders as well as provide day care for the children of students. It currently offers certification in five technical programs: electrical installation, motor vehicle technology, welding and fabrication, hair dressing and beauty therapy, and food and beverage technology.
USAID administers the U.S. foreign assistance program providing economic and humanitarian aid in more than 80 countries worldwide. American Schools and Hospitals Abroad initiative assists overseas schools, libraries, hospitals and centers of excellence to highlight American ideas and practices, to provide concrete illustrations of the generosity of the American people, to further U.S. government public diplomacy and to catalyze collaboration between U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries.","[{'summary_text': 'the project will create an engineering innovation campus to accommodate about 300 Kenyan youths annually . it will include construction of solar-powered classrooms; a demonstration, training and virtual exchange space; dormitory and commons buildings; and workshops equipped for hands-on learning .'}]"
"Go ‘Beyond the Surface’ to build resiliency, self-care to benefit behavioral health","summarize:Note: This article is part of the Purdue HR Benefits’ series “Beyond the Surface,” a call to action to normalize mental health struggles and prioritize mental wellness. “Beyond the Surface” also aligns with the Healthy Boiler Program’s behavioral health pillar, which advocates for integrated care programs that focus on behavioral health and community support.
Individuals who want to take care of their behavioral health can go “Beyond the Surface” and make time to build up their resiliency and self-care. Both are great ways to improve behavioral health and physical health, too. And when individuals go through difficult times – and they will because those are a normal part of life – then they have healthy practices in place to help them cope.
Resilience isn’t a personality trait that only some people possess. On the contrary, it involves behaviors, thoughts and actions that anyone can learn. And it’s best to develop resiliency before it’s needed. That starts with finding healthy ways to recharge and build up a reserve.
There are multiple ways to build resilience. Pick one or two of these ideas to work on. Individuals should give themselves time and grace as they get started.
Take care of the body. Proper nutrition, ample sleep, hydration and exercise help bodies adapt to stress and reduce the toll of negative emotions.
Practice mindfulness. Journaling, yoga, meditation, etc. can help individuals calm their spirits as they deal with difficult situations.
Avoid negative outlets. Alcohol or drugs can add to stress. Some people are also triggered by social media.
Process those big feelings. Whether it’s grief, loss or anger, it’s important to process the emotion. Consider utilizing Purdue’s behavioral health resources for free counseling sessions.
Finding purposeful ways to make self-care part of a regular routine is essential to maintaining or improving overall well-being. To establish a routine, follow these four steps:
Identify: Try out different ways to refresh physically, mentally and spiritually.
Schedule: Pick specific times to engage in these practices.
Reframe: Remember that this is essential to overall well-being.
Repeat: Continue until this is a regular part of everyday life.
Self-care can come in different forms, like physical, mental or spiritual care. Consider the following suggestions for ways to practice each form.
Physical: Exercise and fitness, rest, acupuncture, and breathing techniques can be used to address stress that lives in the body and to alleviate physical pain or tension.
Mental (emotional): Connecting with others, journaling, counseling and listening to music can help tend moods and feelings.
Mental (cognitive): Reading, listening to podcasts and audiobooks, cooking, and creating and appreciating art are all activities that are intellectually rewarding and stimulating.
Spiritual: Volunteering, meditation or yoga, connecting with a spiritual community, and practicing gratitude can help individuals get in touch with the less tangible aspects of the world around them.

Doctoral student plays key role in new genetic testing for helping dog breeders eliminate specific diseases,"summarize:Third-year PhD student Jeanna Blake is excited about the role she’s playing in research aimed at eradicating specific genetic diseases within certain dog breeds. The work is led by anatomy and genetics professor Dr. Kari Ekenstedt in the College of Veterinary Medicine’s Department of Basic Medical Sciences.
Blake conducted the majority of research on glycogen storage disease in Basset Hounds in Ekenstedt’s Canine Genetics Laboratory, which recently solved that disease in Basset Hounds as well as two other genetic diseases in Miniature American Shepherds.
Glycogen storage disease, Blake says, impacts the body’s ability to store glucose in the liver and muscles and then break it down to create energy. The buildup of glycogen in cardiac muscle can cause dogs to go into heart failure. “I was surprised to discover a novel cause of glycogen storage disease in dogs,” Blake says.
“Mutations in the causative gene have been seen in humans but are new to the dog world,” she adds. “The findings of this study add to the mutational spectrum of glycogen storage diseases in dogs. The more disease-causing mutations we are aware of, the broader genetic testing we can do, resulting in earlier disease diagnosis and disease prevention through targeted breeding strategies. The discovery of and testing for this mutation will allow Basset Hounds to be born free of this specific glycogen storage disease.”

Testing may help dog breeders eliminate genetic diseases
As the first such tests offered to the general public for three new canine genetic diseases — hereditary cataracts and neuroaxonal dystrophy in Miniature American Shepherds, as well as glycogen storage disease in Basset Hounds — screenings will enable breeders to identify which dogs are carriers for a disease and could possibly pass it on to offspring. By ensuring two carriers are not bred together, dog owners can halt the disease before it spreads throughout the breed, says Ekenstedt.
“This disease came to my attention after two littermates died quite young from heart failure,” Ekenstedt says. “The pathologist who conducted the autopsies sent me the tissue, which provided us with a set of sibling DNA that could be whole genome sequenced.”
The testing for the genetic mutations will be offered by the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Purdue.
All three diseases are autosomal recessive, which means the mutated gene is not linked to the sex of the animal and that two copies of the mutation are required to cause disease. In other words, dogs with just one copy of the mutation (“carriers”) are healthy but should ideally be bred only to clear dogs — that is, dogs that are free of the mutation — to avoid producing affected puppies.
To solve a genetic disease by identifying a causative mutation, Ekenstedt’s team uses whole genome sequencing on an affected dog’s DNA and compares it against other whole genome sequences in a database of about 1,000 control samples. Complex computational algorithms sort through billions of pieces of data to help the team narrow down specific genes using an established data analysis pipeline. The entire process can take more than a year.
Blake says her hope with canine genetic research is to help dog breeders be able to make informed decisions and avoid breeding dogs that have heritable genetic mutations, gradually eliminating genetic diseases from different dog breeds.
“I have always wanted to help dogs through scientific research. Having the opportunity to contribute to this groundbreaking research means everything to me,” Blake says. “I get to wake up and live my dream every day while contributing to research that directly impacts canine health.”
And knowing that the work being done in the Canine Genetics Lab could prevent even just one Basset Hound puppy from being affected with glycogen storage disease makes all the work worth it, Blake says: “The impact that this research can have on the dog world further reinforces my commitment to canine genetics. I want to help more dogs through my research.”
The two diseases in Miniature American Shepherds, hereditary cataracts and neuroaxonal dystrophy, were largely researched by Dr. Shawna Cook (PhD ’23), now a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University. The research was particularly meaningful to Cook, who is the owner of a Miniature American Shepherd.
“I was stoked,” Cook says. “It definitely pushed this into ‘passion project’ territory. Not only was I given the chance to help dog owners and breeders that I personally know, I was also able to help the breed as a whole. Everyone says that getting a puppy is a lot of work, but my Miniature American Shepherd, Helix, has given that a new definition! Only 3 years old and she’s given me a lot to do! Without her, I never would have met the owners and breeders who have trusted me to conduct this research.”
Cook’s personal tie to the research proved to be inspiring. “The personal connection that I already had with the breed pushed me to be a better scientist and to take charge of my research,” she says. “Weekends, late nights, I was ready at all times to look at data, collect samples and chat with owners.”
While hereditary cataracts aren’t fatal, they are still undesirable for breeders and their clients, who both want healthy pets. Neuroaxonal dystrophy causes degeneration in the animal’s nervous system, causing a wobbly gait and progressive worsening until the animal loses its ability to walk entirely.
“These are preventable genetic diseases,” Ekenstedt says. “By identifying carriers and breeding them with clear dogs, we can keep all the other desirable genetics while completely avoiding the disease. The goal is to test and, slowly, over several generations, replace carrier animals. We don’t want to stop breeding every carrier dog immediately because that could have an overall negative effect on the genetic diversity of the breed.”
Cook says both of the Miniature American Shepherd projects were near to her heart. “Being able to tell the breeders that they will be able to breed these diseases out of their dogs was simply incredible,” she recalls. “Now we can provide the tools needed to aid in the prevention of these heritable diseases. However, there will continue to be inherited diseases, both simple and complex, that exist in our canine companions. No matter the breed, I want to be able to contribute to the breeding of genetically sound puppies. These projects really cemented the fact that I’m doing what I’m meant to be doing. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.”
Ekenstedt describes her research as exploratory, meaning the scientists working in her lab aren’t developing a specific hypothesis and then testing to prove or disprove it. Instead, they learn about abnormalities occurring in a certain breed and analyze DNA from affected animals to identify the specific mutation causing the genetic disease.
“Just like humans, animal genomes mutate every generation,” Ekenstedt says. “These naturally occurring diseases are generated through spontaneous mutations. Many breeders are doing absolutely everything they can to produce healthy dogs, but genetic diseases will still pop up. Having tools to identify disease carriers will be essential to producing healthy puppies, especially in long-established pure breeds with restricted gene pools.”
Many of the student researchers in Ekenstedt’s lab work on single gene mutations, which are typically relatively straightforward to solve. The lab is also working on several more genetically complex diseases that cannot be linked to a single gene.
But there’s one disease — pigmentary uveitis in Golden Retrievers — that Ekenstedt considers her white whale. She and Dr. Wendy Townsend, professor of ophthalmology in the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, have been collaborating for years to try to crack the genetic code of the disease, which affects up to a third of Golden Retrievers.
“The problem with pigmentary uveitis is that it’s painful and inflammatory enough that sometimes dogs end up with their eyes enucleated (removed),” Ekenstedt says. “We’ve used all the same techniques to analyze the whole genome sequence, but it’s been very tricky to identify mutations. There are a number of reasons why it remains elusive, which makes it a really fun, but also frustrating, puzzle to solve. I would be so excited if we can find the answer because there are so many Golden Retrievers in the world, and eliminating that disease would have a tremendously positive impact on the breed.”
With more than 200 dog breeds registered with the American Kennel Club and new breed-specific genetic diseases emerging all the time, Ekenstedt’s lab will continue solving genetic diseases and offering those tests through the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory as they become available. Revenue generated from sales of the tests is funneled back into the ADDL and Ekenstedt’s lab to fund further research.
Offering genetic testing through the ADDL establishes Purdue’s reputation as a pioneering institution in canine genetics, a somewhat neglected field of research. Ekenstedt estimates there are only about a dozen labs in North America conducting canine genetic testing. “I have a crew of brilliant scientists working in my lab,” she says. “I am confident in our team’s ability to solve many more genetic diseases.”
Dr. Becky Wilkes, head of the ADDL’s molecular and virology sections and associate professor of molecular diagnostics in the college’s Department of Comparative Pathobiology, says she’s excited to partner with Ekenstedt to provide this testing for animals.
“Animal genetic testing is a new addition to the ADDL,” Wilkes says, “and we can only provide this service as a result of Dr. Ekenstedt’s expertise in the field. She discovered the genetic changes for which we will be testing that are causing these diseases, which can result in the death of affected puppies. Through this testing and the genetic counseling offered by Dr. Ekenstedt, we will work with breeders to eliminate these genetic diseases in these dog breeds.”","[{'summary_text': 'third-year PhD student Jeanna Blake conducted the majority of research on glycogen storage disease in Basset Hounds . hereditary cataracts and neuroaxonal dystrophy are autosomal recessive, which means the mutated gene is not linked to the sex of the animal .'}]"

Within the Mobile Credentials system launched as Purdue Mobile ID is the Mobile First strategy, which calls for all new students beginning in summer and fall 2023 to have a mobile ID on their smartphones and smartwatches. Mobile First’s goal at Purdue is to eliminate the need for hard-copy ID cards for all 50,000 West Lafayette students over the next few years.
A $25 fee will be assessed for a hard-copy Purdue ID card, and a process is in place for students who can explain why the fee should be waived, said Loribeth Hettinger, senior associate bursar of ID Card Operations/Support.
Graduate students also may need physical cards because some academic buildings, laboratories and other facilities will still require the physical Purdue ID card for access in the short term.
Faculty and staff on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus will continue to use physical IDs and are not participating in the Purdue Mobile ID program, Hettinger said.
Since the launch of Purdue Mobile ID on April 19, over 17,000 Purdue students have downloaded the Transact eAccounts app for using Purdue Mobile ID, including 7,550 planning to attend this fall and 4,270 new students who enrolled this summer, Hettinger said.
Through Purdue Mobile ID, students can add their ID to Apple Wallet or Google Wallet and use their iPhone, Apple Watch or Android devices to access campus buildings, purchase meals and more, Hettinger said. Using Purdue Mobile ID, students can simply hold their device near a reader to access residence halls and campus buildings, make transactions using BoilerExpress, use their meal plans and even pay for laundry.
Purdue has been laying the groundwork to launch Transact Mobile Credentials since 2013, first by updating campus infrastructure for door readers and point-of-sale devices to be mobile-ready. Purdue is installing contactless and tap-to-pay technology using the Transact system through a phased approach across campus.
Purdue Mobile ID was led by Purdue’s ID Card Operations/Support, in partnership with Student Life and Purdue Information Technology. The new Purdue Mobile ID for students is enabled for smartphones via Transact Mobile Credentials.

Purdue’s mark on the Indianapolis 500
The partnership is a natural extension of Purdue’s long-standing role with Indianapolis Motor Speedway – a more than centurylong relationship that began in 1919 with the Purdue “All-American” Marching Band’s first performance at the Indianapolis 500.
The racing connection is a fitting one, as Purdue University boasts one of the country’s most unique and innovative motorsports engineering curriculums, with Purdue University in Indianapolis having the only ABET-accredited undergraduate motorsports engineering program in the United States. Between the campuses in Indianapolis and West Lafayette, Purdue has propelled students and graduates to exciting motorsports careers at the highest levels of racing, including NASCAR, IndyCar and IMSA, as well as with manufacturers, most notably Dallara, a prominent racecar builder, and Cummins, a global power technology leader.
“Purdue University’s persistent pursuit of innovation aligns well with the objectives of Stewart-Haas Racing, making this weekend’s partnership an ideal opportunity to showcase Purdue University in Indianapolis and the world-class engineering, computer science and technology degrees we will offer there from the start,” said R. Ethan Braden, executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer for Purdue University and Purdue Global. “We look forward to serving as the primary sponsor and cheering on Ryan Preece as he goes full throttle this weekend at Indy. The iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway is just a few miles from the Purdue University in Indianapolis campus and multiple downtown locations, including our space at High Alpha in the burgeoning Bottleworks District, where weʼll bring the full force of Purdue to our stateʼs capital city.”
Preece was hand-picked by NASCAR legend and Indiana native Tony Stewart to drive the No. 41 Ford Mustang for Stewart-Haas Racing. Preece is a proven winner, with victories across multiple divisions, including the NASCAR Truck Series and NASCAR Xfinity Series. In June at Sonoma (Calif.) Raceway, Preece won his first ARCA Menards Series race in dominating fashion, winning the pole and leading a race-high 50 laps en route to the victory.
“It’s an honor to represent Purdue University in Indianapolis this weekend at the Brickyard,” said Preece, who first made a name for himself on the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour, winning the championship in 2013. “Indy is filled with history and prestige, and competing there is truly special. To have the gold-and-black colors of the Boilermakers on my car just adds to that prestige, as I’ve come to understand Purdue’s own history at Indianapolis.
“I’m impressed by the program Purdue University has for students looking to make a career in motorsports. Creative, hard-working people can thrive in racing. Knowledge is power, and the more you know, the better you are. To be able to showcase Purdue’s comprehensive urban campus in Indianapolis makes me proud.”
Purdue’s partnership with Stewart-Haas Racing complements the university’s existing motorsport portfolio, which includes the Superstar Racing Experience (SRX), a six-race series co-founded by Stewart in 2021. Purdue University in Indianapolis is the primary sponsor of the car shared by INDYCAR legends Tony Kanaan and Helio Castroneves. Preece recently joined SRX for the series’ second race in July at Stafford (Conn.) Motor Speedway, which serves as Preece’s hometown track as he hails from Berlin, Connecticut.
Purdue University has achieved excellence at scale, with agriculture, graduate engineering and invention counts all among the top four in the United States and across major American research universities, as it ranks first in undergrad STEM enrollment. Now, with ambitious plans for its new Indianapolis campus, Purdue University in Indianapolis will create new knowledge and establish a strong pipeline of Boilermaker talent to the capital city and beyond.
Purdue University in Indianapolis is a new, fully integrated extension of the West Lafayette flagship campus, expanding the academic rigor and accessible excellence that Purdue is known for to Indiana’s industrial and technological center. As the only public top 10 university, most trusted university, and most innovative university in the state of Indiana, Purdue is focused and committed to strengthening its presence in the capital city. Purdue in Indianapolis will reimagine a collaborative platform that connects students, faculty, and local businesses to promote breakthrough discoveries and create a new and direct talent pipeline. Realignment of the existing IUPUI partnership is expected to be completed by the start of the Fall semester in 2024.

Indiana farmland prices continue to rise in 2023,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Indiana farmland prices once again hit record highs in 2023, according to the recent Purdue Farmland Value and Cash Rents Survey. Statewide, the average price of top-quality farmland averaged $13,739 per acre, up 7.3% from June 2022. Average- and poor-quality farmland increased 5.8% and 0.7% to $11,210 and $8,689 per acre, respectively.
“While farmland prices reached a new peak in 2023, the appreciation rate from 2022 to 2023 was much lower than the record-high price growth observed between 2021 and 2022,” said Todd H. Kuethe, the Schrader Endowed Chair in Farmland Economics and the survey’s author. “Farm incomes and liquidity are playing a role in boosting price growth; however, rising interest rates continue to put downward pressure on purchases financed through mortgages.”
Statewide, cash rents increased by a modest amount between 2022 and 2023, yet in nominal terms, all three quality grades are at an all-time high. Per-acre cash rental rates for top-, average- and poor-quality land exceeded the previous highs set in 2013, 2014 and 2021. Indiana per-acre cash rent for top-quality land increased by 1.99% to $306. Cash rental rates for average- and poor-quality land increased by 2.09% and 2.50% to $257 and $212, respectively.
Kuethe says that it’s important to note that these modest changes at the state level mask some of the larger variation across land qualities and regions. For example, cash rental rates grew by 32.8% to 47.2% in the Southeast region for top-, average- and poor-quality land, but cash rental rates fell by 2.2% to 10.7% in the Southwest region. The highest cash rents, across all three quality grades, were observed in the West Central region. Across all regions and quality grades, rent as share of land value (the capitalization rate) held relatively steady between 2022 and 2023.
A divergence was also found in values for farmland transitioning out of agricultural production and those of farmland used for recreational purposes in 2023. Statewide, the per-acre value of farmland transitioning out of agricultural production increased by 4.1% between June 2022 and June 2023 to $25,228. However, the value of recreational land declined by 10.4% to $8,170 per acre.
For more in-depth analysis on the survey, the Purdue Center for Commercial Agriculture has released a new Purdue AgCast episode. Listen as Purdue ag economists Todd Kuethe, James Mintert and Michael Langemeier discuss Indiana farmland values, cash rents and results from the 2023 Purdue Farmland Values and Cash Rents Survey. The two-part series is available for free at https://purdue.ag/farmland-values.
The Department of Agricultural Economics conducts the Purdue Farmland Value and Cash Rents Survey each June and publishes it in the Purdue Agricultural Economics Report. The survey is produced through the cooperation of numerous professionals knowledgeable of Indiana’s farmland market. These professionals provided an estimate of the market value for bare poor-, average- and top-quality farmland in December 2022 and June 2023 and a forecast value for December 2023.

Arequipa Nexus Institute in Peru receives $4 million for phase 3 funding,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The multiphase collaboration Arequipa Nexus Institute for Food, Energy, Water and the Environment has received funding for a third phase of projects from Universidad Nacional de San Agustín. Launched in March 2018 by UNSA in Arequipa, Peru, and Purdue University, the institute is an innovative collaboration focused on key challenges to create a sustainable future for the peoples of Arequipa.
The Arequipa Nexus Institute leverages UNSA faculty, students and infrastructure and the strengths of research faculty and infrastructure from many of Purdue’s colleges, including the College of Agriculture, College of Education, College of Health and Human Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and the Purdue Polytechnic Institute. The colleges will work with UNSA to build capacity and the strategic, long-term collaborations needed to address environmental, agroeconomic and social challenges.
“We are thrilled to continue this important collaboration and provide support that will help UNSA’s faculty address critical environmental challenges while also supporting communities with the greatest needs,” says Lori Hoagland, professor in the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture and co-director of the Arequipa Nexus Institute.
The initial phases of the collaboration occurred between 2018 and 2019 and engaged more than 170 faculty and staff, 38 postdoctoral candidates and over 50 graduate and undergraduate students. The six key topic areas of phases 1 and 2 were natural resources, agriculture and food, technology, sustainable design and teaching, community engagement, and administration. Since the beginning of the collaboration, 51 articles have been published in international scientific journals, over 100 presentations have been given at international conferences and over 100 videos and webinars have been created and distributed.
“We are excited about this new phase of collaborative work with UNSA,” says Daniel Leon-Salas, associate professor in the Purdue Polytechnic Institute and co-director of Arequipa Nexus Institute. “The projects in this phase have been carefully selected based on their potential impact for the people of Arequipa.”
The goal with phase 3 is to continue to build the knowledge, capacity and tools needed to address grand challenges in the region while also focusing on improving the livelihoods of underserved highland communities in the Colca Valley. The new funding from UNSA will focus on projects aimed at supporting the transition to organic food production, improving alpaca fiber quality, designing small-scale renewable energy systems and creating plans for regenerative tourism.
“The ability to address environmental, agroeconomic and social challenges in the country and support the long-term relationship with UNSA is one of the exciting roles we play at Purdue,” says Karen Plaut, executive vice president for research. “It is about research, education and the ability to improve people’s lives by helping them meet their goals. We look forward to working with UNSA to make a difference for Peru.”

Experiments identify important new role of chemical compounds in plant development,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Researchers who manipulate lignin, a molecular fiber that allows plants to grow tall and transport water, unexpectedly discovered its synthesis has more far-reaching effects on plant development than previously suspected.
“My lab has had a long interest in studying the extent to which we can modify plants, specifically the lignin biosynthetic pathway,” said Clint Chapple, Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry at Purdue University. “Of all of the components that make up the plant body, lignin is the one that’s easiest to manipulate. And it has an impact. The pulp and paper process is really about removing lignin.”
Lignin also affects the quality of animal feedstocks and of plant biomass to produce biofuels. “We’ve had some significant success with it over the years. But we ran into a set of observations that we couldn’t explain,” Chapple said.
Chapple’s team genetically engineered the flow of chemical precursors that feed the pathway leading to lignin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely used experimental plant species.
“When we took two strategies that worked quite well on their own and combined them, instead of getting a synergistic effect, we got plants that were only a few inches tall. And we were really puzzled by that,” Chapple recalled.
Researchers proposed four main ideas to explain this phenomenon. “There was a lot of uncertainty over which one, or ones, were correct,” said Fabiola Muro-Villanueva, who earned her PhD in biochemistry at Purdue in 2020.
To learn more, Muro-Villanueva spent several years conducting laborious experiments, testing the effect of various plant-derived chemicals on thousands of plants. In the end, she found a way to restore growth to the plants by providing a compound called pinoresinol. Muro-Villanueva, Chapple and nine co-authors from Purdue and elsewhere published their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
“It seems to be a hormone-like growth compound,” said Muro-Villanueva, now a postdoctoral fellow in molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University.
In the work’s early stages, Muro-Villanueva observed changes in the plants’ production of lateral roots, the branches that make up the root system. And they had changes in the production of root hairs, which are important for water absorption.
“Those are aspects of plant development that don’t really have very much to do with lignin,” Chapple said.
The researchers added back to the plants a compound called coniferyl alcohol, a key precursor compound to lignin formation. This resulted in root hairs that grew big and normal instead of short and deformed-looking.
“That was really very unexpected,” Chapple noted. “It seems that there’s some function for these compounds in plants that we hadn’t appreciated before.”
Until now, plant scientists had widely assumed that pinoresinol serves only as a lignin building block. “Our evidence shows that it’s more than just replacing a building block in lignin. We don’t know the mechanism, but we think there is a much bigger story here,” Muro-Villanueva said.
The findings add new insights to the long list of plant capabilities.
“Plants are excellent chemists. They make a wide variety of compounds that are intrinsically interesting,” Chapple said. Collectively, they make hundreds of thousands of compounds, although individually they often specialize in specific compounds we associate with particular plants.
“They perform many functions. They allow the plant to resist ultraviolet light. So basically, plants make their own sunscreen,” he said. They also deter insect and bacterial attack. And from a human perspective, some of these compounds give our food flavor or aroma, while others provide medicinal properties.
“This is basic research,” Chapple said. “But if we are to move biofuels forward with manipulation of plants to optimize those processes, it’s important that we have a thorough understanding of the roles these pathways and chemicals have in plant development.”
Otherwise, he fears that researchers could put a newly developed variety into the field only to see it fail to perform as expected because they lack a critical understanding of what they can and cannot do with critical biosynthesis pathways.
“We need to have a better understanding of how plants perceive and respond to these compounds,” Chapple said. “And how does their absence lead to these dwarfing effects and alterations in root development?”
This study was supported by the Direct Catalytic Conversion of Biomass to Biofuels (C3Bio), an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science.

Purdue Global trustees approve renaming law school,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue Global Board of Trustees voted Friday (Aug. 4) to change the name of its law school to Purdue Global Law School, effective in November.
Currently known as Concord Law School, the renaming to Purdue Global Law School will better position the law school’s long-term marketing and accreditation efforts and align the school with Purdue Global’s overall branding. It will also meet an expectation of the Indiana Supreme Court, which is reviewing a bar licensure petition to allow the online law school’s graduates to be eligible to sit for the Indiana bar exam and become licensed to practice law in the state.
“While the outcome of that petition is still undecided, the court has made it clear from the beginning that one of its prerequisites would be changing the name of the law school to better align with Purdue,” said Martin Pritikin, dean and vice president of the law school. “It is clear that having Purdue Global more prominent in the name and logo would be advantageous in the long term. Plus, given Purdue Global’s recent rebranding efforts, this is an ideal time for the law school to better align itself with the rest of Purdue Global.”
Several faculty bodies, including the Purdue Global Faculty Senate and the Academic Administrative Council, have approved the name change. Following approval from the Board of Trustees, Purdue Global leadership and staff can begin making the change and submit paperwork to various higher education and accrediting groups.
“The rebranding from Concord Law School to Purdue Global Law School builds upon Purdue Global’s overall strengths and commitment to help working adults, in this case those who want to pursue a law degree,” Purdue Global Chancellor Frank Dooley said. “The law school’s strength is helping those who live in rural or underserved areas become lawyers without having to leave their community. This helps us in that next step.”
The law school is celebrating its 25th anniversary as the nation’s first online law school. One of the school’s goals is to expand access to legal education to increase the availability of legal services, particularly in areas and populations that are underserved.
“The Purdue system is excited to officially welcome a law school to be associated with our name: Purdue Global Law School,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “In the age of online learning, America’s first online law school will continue to grow in scale, excellence and impact.”
In additional business, trustees approved the annual ratification of vice presidents and academic officers and received annual census and financial reports.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey. Purdue Global is a nonprofit, public university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and backed by Purdue University. For more information, visit https://stories.purdue.edu/purdue-global/.

Harris has developed a new conception of racism that says it is primarily actuarial; that is to say, it is a matter of the distribution of life chances, including both health and sickness, and the artificial shortening of life. He calls this “necro-being.” This conception of racism, as well as his new conception of ethics more generally (called “insurrectionist ethics”) and his new conception of philosophy itself (called “philosophy born of struggle”), has had a significant influence on the field of philosophy. Harris’ work has contributed to the creation of the new Africana Philosophy subfield, which has become a disciplinary specialty recognized by the American Philosophical Association. He also has led a fundamental reevaluation of the African American philosopher Alain Locke, and the establishment of Locke as a major figure in the American philosophical movement known as pragmatism. For this work, Harris was awarded the prestigious Herbert Schneider Award of the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy. Additionally, Harris has earned numerous prestigious fellowships and visiting appointments – including Fulbright Scholarships in Ethiopia and Uganda – fellowships at Harvard and the Tuskegee Institute and visiting appointments at Cambridge University and the Catholic University of Leuven.

New university residence to the south of Hillenbrand Hall to further increase availability of on-campus housing,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue University Board of Trustees on Friday (Aug. 4) gave approval to plan, finance, construct and award construction contracts for a new residence hall immediately south of Hillenbrand Residence Hall on the West Lafayette campus.
The new residence hall will be an eight-story, 252,525-square-foot facility that includes 896 pod-style beds. At the same time, the existing dining area in Hillenbrand Residence Hall will be renovated and expanded from approximately 500 to 800 seats to accommodate the additional residents.
The project will help address an existing waitlist and an increased demand for on-campus housing. Additionally, it provides more space for the students in Purdue’s largest living learning community, The Data Mine, to collaborate with each other and with their mentors in the corporate partners program.
Students in The Data Mine emphasize the importance of living and working in the learning community environment. The ability for students to learn data science competencies (on-site, in the residence hall where many of the students live) and to apply these skills in corporate and research settings has been instrumental to the success of The Data Mine.
One of the key goals of Purdue’s transformative education initiative is increasing student success and value by adding housing capacity to ensure there are on-campus living opportunities for undergraduate students.
“The addition of this new residence hall to the West Lafayette campus allows the university to increase the number of on-campus beds and provides more opportunities for the integrated student life experience that we know enhances student success,” said Jay Wasson, Purdue vice president for physical facilities and chief public safety officer.
Earlier this year, Purdue President Mung Chiang directed the creation of the Action Council on Student Housing and Wellbeing under the leadership of Provost Patrick Wolfe and Chief Financial Officer Chris Ruhl. The residence hall project is the second student housing project approved this year to fulfill a primary objective of the action council, and the scope and location of the project are in alignment with the Giant Leaps Housing and Dining Master Plan update that was completed in February.
Since 2013 Purdue enrollment has increased 31%, and the completion of the residence Hall south of Hillenbrand and Third Street and McCormick Road housing projects will contribute to a 35% increase in the number of on-campus beds.
Work is scheduled to start in March 2024 and be completed in June 2026. The estimated total project cost is $149 million, to be funded by non-fee replaced debt.

"Purdue trustees approve new Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building, series of repair and rehabilitation projects","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
In acknowledging the country’s critical workforce needs for skilled nurses and pharmacists and to expand interprofessional education opportunities that mirror modern health care settings, the Purdue University Board of Trustees on Friday (Aug. 4) gave approval to plan, finance, construct and award construction contracts for a Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building on the West Lafayette campus.
The approximately 186,000-square-foot building for the School of Nursing and College of Pharmacy will be located at the corner of Mitch Daniels Boulevard and Russell Street. It will advance collaborative, innovative learning for health care professionals in Indiana.
The facility will support significant enrollment growth that has occurred in both the nursing and pharmacy programs in recent years while being positioned to accommodate forecasted enrollment levels. The project supports the Purdue Moves Transformative Education 2.0  initiative and aligns with the 2018 Giant Leaps campus master plan, the College of Health and Human Sciences master plan and the College of Pharmacy master plan.
Construction is scheduled to start in September 2024 and be completed in October 2026. The estimated cost of the project is $160 million, to be funded by capital cash appropriation from the state ($89 million), gift funds ($45 million) and operating funds – reserves ($26 million).
“We are grateful for the generous support from the Indiana General Assembly and many donors to help make this important facility a reality,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “Both nursing and pharmacy education, along with the overall life science and health capabilities at Purdue, will be substantially boosted.”
In other action, trustees gave approval to plan, finance, construct and award construction contracts for a new, approximately 7,200-square-foot farm building at the Southeast Purdue Agricultural Center in Jennings County, Indiana.
Additionally, trustees gave approval to plan, finance, construct and award construction contracts for the following repair and rehabilitation projects on the West Lafayette campus:

No employee premium increase for 5th straight year as Purdue trustees approve 2024 health plans,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue University Board of Trustees on Friday (Aug. 4) approved 2024 health plans, which will have no employee premium increase for the fifth straight year. The plans for 2024 align with the university’s strategic approach to health care and the Healthy Boiler Wellness Program, and they were designed as part of the ongoing pursuit of improving population health and controlling overall costs for employees and the university.
Updates for the 2024 plan year will be:
A modest increase in medical plan deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums on all three consumer-driven health plans to meet IRS requirements while continuing to create differentials among the three plan offerings and within network tiers. Outside of IRS requirements, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums last increased in 2020.
Expand the operation of the Center for Healthy Living at the Purdue Fort Wayne campus.
Launch a telehealth medicine program, in conjunction with a health care navigation program, through the Center for Healthy Living.
Launch the Healthy Boiler noncash incentive program to further encourage overall wellness and engagement with the various university benefits and partners.
Develop and execute a physical therapy redirection strategy plan to further encourage the use of high-quality, low-cost direct-agreement partners.
Renew the current short-term and long-term disability vendor contract with Guardian for three years.
Renew the current life and accidental death and dismemberment vendor contract with Securian for five years.
Renew the current contract with HSA Bank (medical savings account administrator) for three years with an annual wellness credit being provided to support the university’s Healthy Boiler incentive program.
Premium rates for early retirees will increase by 5% – affecting approximately 250 early retirees who are on medical plans.
Overall university cost increases will continue to be significantly less than the national average. According to data from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the national average for university health care has grown nearly 6% annually since 2016, while Purdue has seen an average increase of only 1% annually. Purdue’s actions to actively manage its health plans have cumulatively saved the university over $148.5 million and saved its employees over $49.5 million. In appreciation for their actions to establish Purdue as a leader in delivering high-quality benefits with innovative population health solutions at the lowest possible costs, in 2022 all employees enrolled in a Purdue medical plan received a cash payment equal to two months of the average employee premium – a total of $3.3 million.
Some 59% of Purdue employees are engaged in HealthSync, a groundbreaking network of high-performing health care providers dedicated to personalized, value-based care. The result has been a savings of $22.3 million since its implementation in 2020 through June 30, 2023. Purdue will continue evaluating options to further expand this network and incentivize the use of HealthSync network providers.
In 2013 Purdue established the Center for Healthy Living, using the patient-centered medical home approach to delivering high-quality, cost-effective primary care. The West Lafayette location has been operated by One-to-One Health since 2017 (with services expanded to Purdue Northwest in 2022), yielding $19.6 million in health care savings.
Purdue’s focus on population health has resulted in 60% of employees and covered spouses completing their annual physical in 2022, the highest completion rate since the Healthy Boiler incentive program began in 2018. The completion rate was 39% in 2017. There also has been a significant increase in mammograms (72% in 2022 vs. 52% in 2017) and colonoscopies (60% in 2022 vs. 28% in 2018).
Employees will begin to receive information related to open enrollment 2024 via email the week of Aug. 7. Communication will continue to focus on members engaging with health care and more fully taking advantage of the various benefit programs Purdue offers.
Open enrollment for 2024 will take place beginning Oct. 24 and continuing through 6 p.m. ET on Nov. 7. Support will be available via presentations, one-on-one counseling, an online guide and a dedicated website. Employees are encouraged to evaluate all medical plan options and other benefits to ensure that they are selecting the best option for themselves and their family.

Trustees approve new Purdue University Airport terminal as exploration of commercial air service continues,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
In action needed before bringing commercial air service for Greater Lafayette to Purdue University Airport, the Purdue University Board of Trustees on Friday (Aug. 4) gave approval to plan, finance, construct and award construction contracts for a new terminal.
This is a significant next step in Purdue serving the state through “ABCD”: Airport for the Greater Lafayette region, Broadband for rural counties, (hard tech) Corridor for central Indiana and Purdue@DC, which brings unique capabilities to our nation’s capital.
“The university has been actively exploring the return of commercial air service to the Purdue University Airport, and the data shows that Purdue University and the Greater Lafayette community’s travel volume could support this service offering,” said Rob Wynkoop, Purdue vice president of auxiliary services. “We have more work to do, but the approval of this project helps ensure the needed infrastructure will be in place when the time comes.”
The approximately 8,000-square-foot facility – to be located west of the existing terminal – will include restrooms, a waiting area, baggage claim, ticketing and passenger screening. It will be constructed to comply with Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration requirements.
“We considered a number of possible terminal solutions, including a renovation of the existing building, and determined the construction of this new facility is the most cost-conscious approach that meets federal requirements,” Wynkoop said.
Existing airport hangar T-1 will be demolished, and new short-term parking will be created in its place. Safety improvements will be made to the railroad track pedestrian crossing.
Construction is scheduled to start in May 2024 and be completed in May 2025. The estimated cost of the project is $11.8 million, to be funded by state funds via the Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative ($7 million), gift funds ($3.3 million) and a federal grant ($1.5 million).
In June, trustees gave approval for the rehabilitation of a Purdue University Airport runway.

Office of Engagement earns national top-10 recognition at Social Innovation Summit,"summarize:Purdue University’s Societal Impact Fellows Program received a top-10 nod at the 2023 Social Innovator of the Year Awards, competing alongside major corporations and global philanthropist organizations, including the U.S. women’s national soccer team, Audible and Lady Gaga’s Born This Way Foundation.
The ceremony took place June 6-7 in Beverly Hills, California, during the Social Innovation Summit, an event platform honoring innovators across the public and private sectors. The Social Innovator of the Year Awards aim to elevate groundbreaking ideas by shining a spotlight on innovative leaders whose work addresses urgent social issues. This year’s summit attracted 900 attendees, including social impact executives and other leaders from Microsoft, John Deere, the White House and more.
Launched in 2021, the Societal Impact Fellows Program drives innovation in partnership through the convening, mentoring and training of faculty and staff whose research is rooted in boots-on-the-ground, reciprocal and community-based collaborations. Since its inception, 27 fellows have been trained in societal impact methodology, resulting in the creation of meaningful partnerships that support the university’s tripartite mission of teaching and learning, discovery and engagement.
Rod Williams, associate provost for engagement and professor of wildlife science in the Department of Forestry and National Resources, says this high-level recognition on a national stage showcases Purdue’s ability to produce impactful research that advances social innovation in academia and beyond.
“This demonstrates how progressive, cutting-edge and innovative Purdue has been in training faculty and staff and using research to solve societal problems,” Williams said.  “Purdue is well-known for that, but this proves it. It verifies that engaged scholars at Purdue are having a real impact on society, and for me, that’s what’s really exciting.”
Throughout the program, senior faculty mentors work with fellows to help them develop research impact plans, enhance their collaboration skills and form broad networks of societal impact-focused peers and partners. Weekly workshops featuring presentations and breakout sessions have allowed fellows like Darrin Karcher, associate professor of animal sciences and poultry Extension specialist, develop long-term and short-term project goals and discover new ways to measure their work’s effects.
Fostering partnerships isn’t new to Karcher; it’s simply part of his job. When he enrolled in the spring 2022 cohort, he was searching for ways to enrich the impact of a five-year research grant from the United States Department of Agriculture and National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Karcher’s research focuses on developing new methods to create cage-free housing systems for laying hens, and since completing the program, he feels better prepared to understand how his work affects egg producers, the egg industry, consumers and U.S. egg production as a whole.
“It helped me think about new ways I can use the tools Purdue provides to cultivate unique partnerships and relationships to further extend my impact within the local community, the state, nationwide and across the globe,” Karcher says. “When you walk away from that experience, I can guarantee that you will have a more enriched and better engaged program that helps you expand the scope of what you can actually do to leave a lasting impact.”
To further extend the impact of the fellows program, the Office of Engagement team plans to analyze data from past cohorts and use it to develop a new model that other academic institutions can use to develop their own community of engaged scholars. Eventually, Williams hopes to construct Purdue’s own engaged scholar association, where like-minded individuals can come together each year to exchange ideas, collaborate and inspire each other.
Williams says the recent top-10 recognition will help the Office of Engagement amplify awareness of the fellows program as it works to extend its availability within the Purdue system, including Purdue in Indianapolis, and beyond.
“Any university that gets recognized nationally for engaged scholarship and shows that faculty are being acknowledged to that extent is opening the pathway for additional faculty to see that there are benefits to these efforts and this type of scholarship,” Williams said. “It just paves the way for more; it’s a positive feedback loop.”
The Societal Impact Fellows Program is open to West Lafayette faculty and staff who are able to submit proposals for external funding and are interested in fostering societal impact. Questions about program and its next cohort can be directed to Rod Williams at rodw@purdue.edu.","[{'summary_text': ""the program is open to west Lafayette faculty and staff who are able to submit proposals for external funding . since its inception, 27 fellows have been trained in societal impact methodology, resulting in meaningful partnerships that support the university's tripartite mission .""}]"
"Connection between cyberbullying, back-to-school important to recognize","summarize:Almost everyone has experienced bullying, either directly or indirectly and as a victim and/or perpetrator. Common types of bullying include physical, verbal, social and more, including cyberbullying, which is becoming more popular as the majority of individuals (and teens) have access to mobile devices.
As the new school year nears, it’s especially important for parents and guardians to be aware of what cyberbullying is so they can support the kids in their lives if and when needed. So, what is cyberbullying? Cyberbullying, as defined by stopbullying.gov, is “bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text and apps, or online in social media, forums or gaming where people can view, participate in or share content.”
According to a January 2019 Google survey, teachers report that cyberbullying is their No. 1 safety concern in their classrooms. And with good reason.
Dosomething.org, a global hub of young people focused on changing the world, reports that about 37 percent of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 have experienced online bullying, and 30 percent have had it happen to them more than once. Additionally, the platform shares that 95 percent of teens in the United States are online and their mobile devices are the most common medium for cyberbullying. See their “11 Facts About Cyberbullying” article for more facts. Additional information about bullying and cyberbullying from DoSomething is available here.
Cyberbullying might look like:
Posting comments or rumors about someone online that are mean, hurtful or embarrassing.
Threatening to hurt someone or telling them to kill themselves.
Posting a mean or hurtful picture or video.
See “Cyberbullying Tactics” for additional information.
With cyberbullying being so prevalent, the first step is for those who are affected to report it. The “Report Cyberbullying” web page provides steps to take and where to report any incidents of cyberbullying.
There is quite a bit of information and resources available on the topic. For instance, the Cyberbullying Research Center provides an extensive collection of resources, research and more, including:
Cyberbullying Statistics
Cyberbullying Keynotes & Workshops
Cyberbullying Student Presentations & Assemblies
Cyberbullying Parent and Community Presentations

Purdue animal sciences faculty members receive USDA grants for animal welfare research,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Faculty members in Purdue University’s Department of Animal Sciences have received $1.4 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture for research on safeguarding animal welfare. Both projects pertain to poultry production, a major contributor to the U.S. and Indiana economies.
Marisa Erasmus, associate professor of animal sciences, received a four-year, $793,000 grant to devise methods for improving laying-hen welfare against a parasite called the northern fowl mite. Gregory Fraley, the Terry and Sandra Tucker Endowed Chair of Poultry Science, has received a four-year, $647,000 grant to investigate how to improve poultry welfare through a better understanding of the visual system in ducks. Their grants are among 13 awards totaling $7.5 million allocated to 11 universities and the USDA Agricultural Research Service.
“One of the major health issues for laying hens is external parasites, but hens do not all respond to parasites in the same way,” Erasmus said. “Even though they look very similar, chickens have individual responses, and some are more susceptible to parasites than others.”
Erasmus is collaborating on her project with Luiz Brito, associate professor of animal sciences at Purdue, and Purdue alumna Amy Murillo, assistant professor of entomology at the University of California, Riverside. The team also is working closely with Hy-Line International, the world leader in egg-laying hen breeding, to address the issue.
“Indiana is a huge poultry state. We’re uniquely situated here to work closely with our poultry collaborators and industry stakeholders,” Erasmus said. “We’ll tackle the problem from different angles and hopefully provide some guidance as to what the industry can do to reduce the impacts of these external parasites.”
The northern fowl mite is the most economically costly to the nation’s egg industry, causing decreased welfare and lost production in millions of laying hens. Current methods to fight this scourge are limited, however.
The considerable individual variation among laying hens potentially offers genetic or genomic solutions to the problem. The Purdue-UC Riverside team is combining its expertise in animal behavior, genetics and genomics, and entomology to holistically understand how individual hens differ in their ability to resist mite infestations. Can chickens be bred, for example, to have certain traits that will make them more resistant to external parasites?
Another aspect of the research is the industry changeover from housing egg-laying chickens in cages to cage-free housing systems.
“Controlling pests in cage-free systems is more complicated and challenging than cages,” Erasmus observed. “These types of parasites are resistant to some insecticides. And we’re limited as to insecticides that can be used while making a product that’s going to be food for human consumption.”
Fraley is collaborating on his project with Darrin Karcher, associate professor of animal sciences, and Esteban Fernandez-Juricic, professor of biological sciences. Indiana is the largest duck-producing state in the nation, which is the world’s third-largest duck producer. Poor welfare and unwanted behaviors can lead to productivity losses that cost the duck industry millions of dollars a year.
Fraley’s team is working with two industry partners, Maple Leaf Farms and Culver Duck.
“Those two companies are the two largest duck producers in the United States,” Fraley said. “They’ve been absolutely fantastic partners, and they’re very interested in what we’re doing.”
All poultry species are seasonal breeders, meaning that they need long days to grow and lay eggs. “Other than that, very little consideration has ever been given to the lighting,” Fraley said. “Most of the lighting systems are designed for the benefit of the people that work with the animals, not really taking into consideration how it may affect the animals’ perception of their environment.”
Mammals, including humans, have three different types of color receptors and a grayscale receptor in their eyes. Bird eyes, meanwhile, have four or perhaps five different types of color receptors. They also have a double cone, a type of color receptor of unknown function. Scientists do know, however, that birds can see ultraviolet colors and probably some infrared.
“There is absolutely nothing in our human experience that can prepare us to understand how a bird visualizes its environment,” Fraley said.
Ducks, like chickens, often lay their eggs outside of their nest boxes, where they become covered in excrement and have to be thrown away.
“Maybe the lighting is such that they can’t really see their nest boxes if they’re far enough away. We don’t know what the problems are, but we’re trying to eliminate these unwanted behaviors that literally cost the poultry industry millions of dollars a year,” he said.

Gourmet or imitation? New technique ferrets out food fraud,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
When you shell out for artisanal food – Swiss Gruyère cheese, organic vanilla extract, Italian prosciutto – did you get what you paid for? With global food fraud estimates as high as $40 billion a year, it’s a question Purdue University researchers are tackling with a food “fingerprint” technique sensitive enough to distinguish between foods made from the same ingredients, but in different locations.
Food fraud, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration officially terms “economically motivated adulteration,” occurs when manufacturers substitute a cheaper ingredient for one that is more valuable, like cutting olive oil with vegetable oil, or bulking saffron with ground plant stems. It’s a tough crime to catch as foods can be altered anywhere along a global supply chain. Ensuring authenticity is even more difficult when dishonest purveyors simply swap a similar product for its more expensive counterpart, like Himalayan sea salt, or San Marzano tomatoes.
“Think about the difference between a free-range ham from Portugal, aged in a cave for two years, and a ham you buy at WalMart,” said Bartek Rajwa, a research professor of computational life sciences at Purdue University. “They are both pig meat, the same ingredients, but they have a very different taste, smell and texture. To tell them apart, we need a system that can quantitatively analyze those characteristics. It’s a big challenge.”
Rajwa and his team are developing a patent-pending two-part process to provide information about the atomic composition and chemical structure of a food sample, enough to pinpoint the ingredients, the preparation and, potentially, the point of origin.
Published results from a test using the first step as a standalone method were 99% accurate in distinguishing imitation vanilla flavoring from real vanilla extract, and about 90% accurate in identifying European cheese branded as “Gruyère” versus a Gruyère-style cheese produced in Wisconsin. Earlier this year, Rajwa presented the more sophisticated two-part process at the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Sensing for Agriculture and Food Quality and Safety XV conference.
Rajwa, an expert in biological analysis techniques, stumbled upon the field of food authentication as part of his work developing systems to recognize bacterial contamination of foods.
“I started going to food science conferences and listening to leaders in the field, and that’s when I realized the scale of the problem,” Rajwa said. “We’re talking about an enormous criminal enterprise that is almost unnoticed. Most of the time the only harm is that you’re paying a premium and getting a product of inferior quality, but there are instances in which it can cause serious harm.”
Many spectroscopy methods, including mass spectrometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography are used to identify food. However, Rajwa said, none of the existing methods are fool-proof, and most are difficult and expensive, leaving ample room for innovation in the field.
To meet the challenge, Rajwa and Purdue collaborators J. Paul Robinson and Euiwon Bae turned to Laser Induced Breakdown Spectrosopy (LIBS), a method that’s well developed for use in material science and metallurgy, but not commonly used in food science. LIBS uses a high-powered laser to create a tiny plume of plasma at the surface of a sample. The intensity of different wavelengths of light emitted by the plasma indicates the type and proportion of elements that make up the ingredients in the sample and even provides some valuable information on its texture. LIBS creates a unique digital spectrum, which, with a machine-learning approach Rajwa’s team developed for the task, is processed into a fingerprint that can be used to verify the identity of the food tested.
In a paper published in Foods, the team tested several samples of Alpine-style cheese, coffee, vanilla extract, balsamic vinegar, and spices like nutmeg, pepper, and turmeric. For many foods, the method was highly accurate, even when using an inexpensive portable handheld LIBS instrument. But for more complex foods, like the Alpine-style cheese, Rajwa said, the LIBS spectrum isn’t enough.
For additional information that can help verify the origin of even complex foods like cheese and ham, he is working on a second step using Raman spectroscopy, which is capable of identifying specific organic molecules, such as those associated with the presence of pesticides, fungicides or antibiotics in food.
“In a sense, they form this complementary pair; what one cannot detect, the other can,” Rajwa said. “LIBS gives you the amount of each atom, and Raman tells you how they are organized.”
At the SPIE conference, Rajwa presented data with the two-part method showing improvements in accuracy over LIBS as a standalone method; final results have not yet been published.
This research was funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, under Agreement No. 59-8072-6-001, and with the help of SciAps Inc., which supplied portable LIBS instruments. Rajwa disclosed the innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent on the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in further developing the research for the marketplace can contact Dipak Narula at dnarula@prf.org.

"Anu awarded $200,000 grant to mass manufacture its aeroponic seed pods that grow produce in controlled environments","summarize:EVANSVILLE, Ind. —
A startup company founded by Purdue University alumni has received funding from the state of Indiana to advance the manufacture of its products.
Heliponix LLC, doing business as anu™ (previously gropod®), has received a $200,000 Indiana Manufacturing Readiness Grants (MRG) award to mass manufacture its aeroponic seed pod consumables.
Manufacturing Readiness Grants are provided by the Indiana Economic Development Corp. and administered by Conexus Indiana and the Next Level Manufacturing Institute. They are available to Indiana manufacturers willing to make capital investments to integrate smart technologies and processes that improve capacity, productivity and competitiveness. Launched in 2020, the MRG program has supported tech-enabled investment in smart manufacturing all around the state.
Anu, founded by Purdue Polytechnic Institute alumni Scott Massey and Ivan Ball, sells a smart garden appliance. The small, fully automated, in-home greenhouse grows daily servings of produce from subscription seed pods.
Aeroponics is a form of hydroponics, or growing plants without soil. Massey said the pods empower consumers to grow fresh, high-quality produce including most leafy green vegetables, culinary herbs, ornamental/flowering plants and an increasing number of fruiting plant varieties such as peppers, tomatoes and more in a controlled environment.
“Our cultivation chambers use deep-learning, computer-vision algorithms to produce higher yields than other controlled-environment agriculture technology,” Massey said. “The chambers consume less energy and more than 95 percent less water than conventional field farming. With zero use of pesticides or preservatives, they represent an environmentally friendly solution for year-round accelerated growing.”
Massey said the funding will allow anu to scale a sustainable platform for consumers by supplying growers with recurring seed pod subscriptions.
“This funding has dramatically increased our ability to manufacture these seed pods, but in a volume that will quickly outpace the collective yields of the largest farms in the world,” Massey said. “It further accelerates our pursuit to collectively become the largest farm in the world without owning any land.”
Mitch Landess, vice president of innovation and digital transformation at Conexus Indiana, said manufacturing entrepreneurship, especially when it involves technology, is vital for Indiana.
“Small firms founded and led by entrepreneurs that leverage the resources around them and form credible partnerships are interesting to the Manufacturing Readiness Grants program,” Landess said. “The mix of intellectual property, local venture capital, Small Business Innovation Research funding and participation of larger manufacturing partners made it easy to support anu’s investment in production technology.”
Conexus Indiana recently named Massey to the Conexus Indiana Rising 30 Class of 2023, which recognizes distinguished advanced manufacturing and logistics professionals under the age of 30.
Massey said he and his colleagues at anu appreciate support from Conexus for the Rising 30 recognition and from the IEDC for the $200,000 Manufacturing Readiness Grants award.
“It was only a few years ago that I was a Purdue University student with an idea and the drive to bring it to the market — to empower everyone to grow their own produce. Conexus has done a phenomenal job extending these resources and recognition to make this idea a reality as we continue growing our highly experienced team, creating jobs and attracting more talent to the great state of Indiana,” Massey said.
“Indiana’s support for small businesses is not just unparalleled, but Indiana’s long-standing history of advanced manufacturing has resulted in it being the best possible headquarter base for us.”
Anu received a $100,000 investment from the Ag-Celerator Fund, co-founded by the Purdue Research Foundation and Purdue’s College of Agriculture. It also has received Phase I and Phase II SBIR grants from the National Science Foundation and matching funds from Elevate Ventures.

Decades of research have left knowledge gaps about cells that regulate the immune system: Purdue and NIH,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Four decades of research have produced a vast pool of knowledge about regulatory T cells, a subset of our immune cells. Even so, scientists at Purdue University and the National Institutes of Health have identified 14 understudied T-reg proteins that merit increased attention for the molecular roles they play in disease onset.
“Our lab studies the exact molecular mechanism underlying autoimmunity, infection and cancer,” said Majid Kazemian, associate professor of biochemistry in the College of Agriculture and computer science in the College of Science at Purdue. An overactive immune system results in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. And an underactive immune system means greater susceptibility to cancer. “This is the balance that exists in some cells. T-regs maintain those balances,” he said.
Kazemian joined with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s Jorge Trujillo-Ochoa and Behdad (Ben) Afzali in reviewing the body of research about T-reg cells in the journal Nature Reviews Immunology. Kazemian and Afzali have contributed multiple publications to that body of work, including one on T-regs and autoimmune disease in 2018 and another on T-regs and cancer in 2021. Lead author Trujillo-Ochoa, an NIH postdoctoral fellow, specializes in regulatory T-cell biology and the proteins that control their function.
“Regulatory T cells are only a small percentage of the T cells that we have in our body, but you can’t live without them,” said Afzali, a Stadtman Investigator at NIH’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
“Studying T cell processes at the molecular level is critical to understanding their implications on human diseases,” Afzali said. “If one of these processes goes wrong, you can get organ-specific disease. Understanding how these cells work also gives you the opportunity to intervene with molecules that can modify some of their functions.”
The review article focuses on transcription factors — proteins that regulate sets of genes, which program regulatory cells to perform certain actions.
“In theory, you may find some of these programs are abnormal in patients who develop diseases,” Afzali said. “Understanding these molecular mechanisms is important to make that connection in diseases.” For example, if a virus switches off one of those transcription factors, the result might be a defect in a cellular program that leads to a corresponding autoimmune disease.
T-reg cells have particular transcription factors that maintain the core function of dampening the activity of other immune cells.
“We could have additional transcription factors that amend specific functions,” Kazemian said. “To identify what factors drive some of the T-regs toward certain paths is going to help us prevent autoimmunity or to help cancer patients by fine-tuning particular T-regs. What happens to them that they acquire a specific property or functionality?”
Each line of specialized cells could have a different function in various organs and diseases. “For example, we have shown that a specific gene in the T-regs called TCF1 is associated with colorectal cancer disease severity,” Kazemian said.
Afzali, an M.D.-PhD, is especially interested in cell therapy that involves removing regulatory cells, altering them outside the body, then putting them back in.
“Regulatory T cells as a form of cell-based therapy is just one arm of this incredible field,” Afzali said. “It’s a blossoming area of research, and we’re learning more about what can and can’t be done.”
This work was supported by the NIH, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research.

Purdue thermal imaging innovation allows AI to see through pitch darkness like broad daylight,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Researchers at Purdue University are advancing the world of robotics and autonomy with their patent-pending method that improves on traditional machine vision and perception.
Zubin Jacob, the Elmore Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and research scientist Fanglin Bao have developed HADAR, or heat-assisted detection and ranging. Their research was featured on the cover of the July 26 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Nature. A video about HADAR is available on YouTube. Nature also has released a podcast episode that includes an interview with Jacob.
Jacob said it is expected that one in 10 vehicles will be automated and that there will be 20 million robot helpers that serve people by 2030.
“Each of these agents will collect information about its surrounding scene through advanced sensors to make decisions without human intervention,” Jacob said. “However, simultaneous perception of the scene by numerous agents is fundamentally prohibitive.”
Traditional active sensors like LiDAR, or light detection and ranging, radar and sonar emit signals and subsequently receive them to collect 3D information about a scene. These methods have drawbacks that increase as they are scaled up, including signal interference and risks to people’s eye safety. In comparison, video cameras that work based on sunlight or other sources of illumination are advantageous, but low-light conditions such as nighttime, fog or rain present a serious impediment.
Traditional thermal imaging is a fully passive sensing method that collects invisible heat radiation originating from all objects in a scene. It can sense through darkness, inclement weather and solar glare. But Jacob said fundamental challenges hinder its use today.
“Objects and their environment constantly emit and scatter thermal radiation, leading to textureless images famously known as the ‘ghosting effect,’” Bao said. “Thermal pictures of a person’s face show only contours and some temperature contrast; there are no features, making it seem like you have seen a ghost. This loss of information, texture and features is a roadblock for machine perception using heat radiation.”
HADAR combines thermal physics, infrared imaging and machine learning to pave the way to fully passive and physics-aware machine perception.
“Our work builds the information theoretic foundations of thermal perception to show that pitch darkness carries the same amount of information as broad daylight. Evolution has made human beings biased toward the daytime. Machine perception of the future will overcome this long-standing dichotomy between day and night,” Jacob said.
Bao said, “HADAR vividly recovers the texture from the cluttered heat signal and accurately disentangles temperature, emissivity and texture, or TeX, of all objects in a scene. It sees texture and depth through the darkness as if it were day and also perceives physical attributes beyond RGB, or red, green and blue, visible imaging or conventional thermal sensing. It is surprising that it is possible to see through pitch darkness like broad daylight.”
The team tested HADAR TeX vision using an off-road nighttime scene.
“HADAR TeX vision recovered textures and overcame the ghosting effect,” Bao said. “It recovered fine textures such as water ripples, bark wrinkles and culverts in addition to details about the grassy land.”
Additional improvements to HADAR are improving the size of the hardware and the data collection speed.
“The current sensor is large and heavy since HADAR algorithms require many colors of invisible infrared radiation,” Bao said. “To apply it to self-driving cars or robots, we need to bring down the size and price while also making the cameras faster. The current sensor takes around one second to create one image, but for autonomous cars we need around 30 to 60 hertz frame rate, or frames per second.”
HADAR TeX vision’s initial applications are automated vehicles and robots that interact with humans in complex environments. The technology could be further developed for agriculture, defense, geosciences, health care and wildlife monitoring applications.
Jacob and Bao disclosed HADAR TeX to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent on the intellectual property. Industry partners seeking to further develop the innovations should contact Dipak Narula, dnarula@prf.org about 2020-JACO-68773.

Purdue research awards and philanthropic fundraising both new records in fiscal year 2023,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University has announced it reached new milestones in both research awards and gift funding for fiscal year 2022-23, shattering previous records for both research funding and donor giving to the university. Purdue received $613 million in research awards during the fiscal year that ran from July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023. Concurrently, Purdue received a record $610 million in private contributions. These two new records mark the first time in university history that either category surpassed $600 million in a year.
“Excellence at scale is both reflected in and further supported by these two new watermarks, simultaneously achieved at Purdue this past year,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “Annual percentage increases around 10% for research funding and for philanthropic gifts continue the compounding rise and are based on the persistent pursuit in excellence by our faculty, staff and students and the incredible generosity of Boilermaker family and friends.”
The university’s total research awards have steadily climbed each year since 2013. The total amount represents a 9% increase in awards from fiscal year 2022 and a 92% hike over the last 11 years (FY 2013 to FY 2023), with this year’s funding supporting approximately 3,500 research projects. This year’s funding is benchmarked as high for a university without either a medical school or a major Department of Defense establishment.
As part of this record funding, Purdue has seen a significant uptick in larger awards from federal agencies through highly competitive processes, which account for 70% of the research funding at Purdue, with the U.S. Department of Defense topping the list for the first time at $98 million. In FY23, DoD authorized $20 million to advance SCALE, the preeminent U.S. program for semiconductor workforce development in the defense sector.
Other top sponsors include the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the National Institute of Health ($95 million), National Science Foundation ($81 million), U.S. Department of Agriculture ($62 million), U.S. Department of Energy ($41 million) and state and local government ($43 million).
Private industry also contributed nearly $90 million to support Purdue research, and the university signed 11 master research agreements, including a new commitment of $50 million from Eli Lilly and Company toward a five-year strategic research collaboration.
“This new record for research awards funding demonstrates the strength of Purdue research and, perhaps even more importantly, the impact of our work by our faculty, staff and students,” said Karen Plaut, executive vice president for research. “Through concentrated effort, Purdue has successfully increased the diversity of our funding sources, providing more opportunities for our researchers across all areas of study and training the next generation of scientific leaders.”
Highlights include:
$7.8 million in funding from the Semiconductor Research Corp., DARPA and Georgia Institute of Technology for research in two JUMP 2.0 research centers – the Center for the Co-Design of Cognitive Systems (CoCoSys) and the Center on Cognitive Multispectral Sensors (CogniSense) – to accelerate U.S. advances in information and communications technologies.
A $10 million award from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to fuel economic resilience and sustainability in Eastern U.S. forests.
A $6.8 million award from the National Institutes of Health in support of the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, which works to increase collaboration among the brightest minds in Indiana to solve the state’s most pressing health care challenges.
A $3.9 million award from the National Institutes of Health to demystify the link between obesity and breast cancer.
In addition to research awards, Purdue hit an all-time high of more than $610 million from 83,836 donors. These gifts come from generous donations from alumni, students, families, partners and foundations, and are often specified for each gift’s intended purpose.
FY23 is also the 11th consecutive year that the total raised for student support has increased. Purdue raised $183 million for student support – a 22% increase over last year.
“Purdue has had another monumental year in private giving, thanks to the generosity of our alumni, friends and fans,” said Matt Folk, president and CEO of the Purdue for Life Foundation and vice president of university advancement and alumni engagement for Purdue University. “Together, through small steps and giant leaps, we are strengthening Purdue’s reputation in teaching and research while remaining affordable and accessible to brilliant young minds.”
Records that Purdue donors set this year include:
Total dollars raised: $610.3 million, an increase of 12.6% from last year’s total and the previous record of $542.1 million.
Dollars raised for student support: $183 million, up from last year’s record of $150 million. The university has seen a giant leap in private support for scholarships, fellowships and student programming each year since 2012-13, when Purdue raised $32 million for student support.
Largest single-day fundraising campaign in higher education: $110.8 million from Purdue Day of Giving, shattering last year’s record of $68.2 million and bringing Purdue Day of Giving’s cumulative total since it launched in 2014 to $420.5 million.

"Pro bono work helps students gain experience, keep faculty on top of legal changes","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
As a lawyer and Concord Law School administrator, Shaun Jamison impresses upon his law students the importance of giving back and being a force for good.
Jamison, of St. Louis Park, Minnesota, serves as Concord’s associate dean of academic affairs and provides pro bono services through Minnesota Legal Advice Online.
Jamison has supervised three Concord students who completed their externships with the online legal service. The students helped people in need of free legal guidance regarding housing, employment, child support, benefits, consumer rights and debt collections. Jamison also was recently recognized by the Minnesota State Bar Association in the May/June 2023 edition of Bench & Bar Magazine for providing 50 or more hours of pro bono legal services in 2022.
While pro bono work is not a graduation requirement, Jamison says it can be a way for students to explore various legal areas. Students can volunteer on their own or do pro bono work at legal aid offices, with public defenders or at other non-profit organizations serving low-income legal clients. They can earn academic credit for doing so if they complete 70 hours of such work over the course of a semester through Concord’s Legal Education Experience Program, or LEEP.
“Pro bono work is one way for law students and the legal community to help individuals who are in need and might not otherwise be served,” Jamison said. “Unresolved legal matters negatively affect the financial outlook and health of people involved. And unrepresented clients can affect court resources.”
M.J. (Matt) Conaway (Executive Juris Doctorate ’22) was in need of an externship. Jamison offered Conaway the opportunity to work remotely with him on the online service.
Conaway, who lived in Iowa at the time, was eager to help – and had to learn Minnesota civil law. “It was interesting to work with the legal code of a state different than my own,” Conaway said.
Conaway was diagnosed with mixed quadriplegic spastic athetoid cerebral palsy at birth, and Concord helped him grow in his desire to become a stronger bioethicist and disability policy scholar. He is a staff scholar at the Institute for Strategic Change.
“The pro bono work has strengthened my skills for my advocacy and policy work,” Conaway said.
Jamison said the personal experiences of students and attorneys can add a deeper understanding of the needs of pro bono clients that better enable them to advocate for those clients beyond their immediate legal needs.
“Law students can be future policymakers who can advocate for resources and better policies to avoid the problems that pro bono addresses,” Jamison said. “It’s important for the public to understand that law students and lawyers can be a force for good.”
Concord Law School is part of Purdue Global, Purdue’s online university for working adults. Concord is celebrating its 25th anniversary as the nation’s first online law school.

Purdue response to Inside Higher Ed regarding Indianapolis faculty,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The following are responses sent to Inside Higher Ed in response to questions about faculty during the transition from IUPUI to Purdue University in Indianapolis.
July 24, 2023
As you can see in the attached, which was sent to IUPUI faculty yesterday, there will be (1) no reduction of workforce; (2) no change to rank, compensation, or the location and type of research and teaching; and (3) even though the tenure cases were voted on by IU, after the transition to a different university, Purdue has chosen to still provide tenure, i.e., what many refer to as “lifetime job security,” to those currently holding IU tenure, and tenure-track assistant professor positions to those currently on tenure-track.
In many cases where a university dissolves and some of the programs are moved into a new university, there tends to be a reduction in workforce, rank and tenure.
Not in this case.
Purdue has made that clear in the definitive agreement signed on June 14 and posted publicly for over a month now: https://www.purdue.edu/bot/meetings/past-meetings/2023/06.%20june%2014/Program%20Transfer%20Agreement%20IUPUI.pdf
The individual listening sessions I mentioned last week continue through the end of next week, and at their completion, further communication will be provided about the timetable between July 2023 and July 2024, when the transition takes place.
July 25, 2023:
Purdue University in Indianapolis will not officially exist until July 1, 2024, and no official offers have been extended yet to the 74 interested faculty members. In the individual meetings, we’ve presented an array of potential options and have listened to faculty.
Teaching duties and research support will not change.
Furthermore, as you have read in the signed agreements released in public:
Purdue has elected to honor the tenure of faculty after this transition from one university to another university, even though their tenure resides currently with IU.
Compensation will remain the same or higher.
Purdue University and IUPUI are two different universities, with different hiring and tenure standards. Purdue departmental votes on lifelong job security are based on the same standard as in any such Purdue departmental votes. The timeline will be the same too: Departmental votes are to be followed by college votes, followed by annual university votes (Feb 2024) followed by annual BOT votes (April 2024).
Any accusation of discrimination at departmental votes is ridiculous and patently false.
The following message was sent to IUPUI faculty on July 24
Dear Colleagues,
First, thank you for your patience as we all take on the important year-long work that follows the June 14, 2023, signing of the definitive agreements for Purdue University in Indianapolis to be created in July 2024. I appreciate the chance to meet each of you individually and hear your thoughts and concerns directly, in a process that started this month and continues over the next two weeks.
I know this is an anxious time, and I urge you to read the agreements here, if you haven’t already. Importantly, please note section A.1. of ARTICLE III, which makes it clear that faculty will retain the same academic rank and tenure and promotion status if they choose to move from IUPUI to Purdue University in July 2024: “Purdue will offer employment, effective as of the Realignment Effective Date, to all full-time and part-time academic faculty of IUPUI who are working in a Purdue Realigned Academic Unit as of June 30, 2024 (collectively, the “IU Transferred Faculty”). To the greatest extent practicable, Purdue will offer, honor and provide the same faculty appointment classification (e.g., clinical, research, tenured or tenure-track), academic rank designation, current tenure probationary period credit, and tenure and promotion status of each IU Transferred Faculty as of the Realignment Effective Date.”
In short, there will be (1) no reduction of workforce, (2) no change for current tenured and tenure-track faculty to rank, compensation, or the location and type of research and teaching, and (3) even though the tenure cases were voted by IU, Purdue has nonetheless elected, as part of its agreement with IU to facilitate a transition to a new university, to provide tenure to those currently with IU tenure, and tenure-track assistant professor positions to those currently on tenure-track.
Some individual listening sessions have taken place while others are about to take place this and next week. At the end of next week, as my listening sessions conclude, we will provide further information regarding a timetable leading to the July 2024 effective date and faculty placement opportunities.
We promise to continue to work alongside each of you as we move toward positive outcomes for Purdue and its people.
Please do not hesitate to work with me if you have questions or concerns.

Indiana Mesonet holds meeting to educate and form advisory board,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Dozens of weather and climate experts came together on July 18 to support the Purdue Mesonet, a statewide network of weather observation stations managed by the Indiana State Climate Office, which delivers climate data, tools, data visualizations and resources to enhance Indiana’s prosperity and decision-support needs. Aiming to educate potential stakeholders and partners, the Purdue Mesonet rallied support around the need for an advisory board to guide the network through its growth.
With a long-term goal of expanding the existing 13-site network into at least one station per each of Indiana’s 92 counties, meteorologists from the National Weather Service and surrounding states’ Mesonets presented their cases on ways the network impacts daily life for residents across the state, as well as residents just on the other side of Indiana’s state borders.
Beth Hall, Indiana state climatologist, said the need for higher-quality, unbiased data collection will allow for better efforts in monitoring conditions, which will allow for better services to areas such as agriculture, construction, health and wellness, and urban planning.
“We need good data to do good research,” Hall said. “What we see in other states with broad Mesonet operations is they can convert their data into, for example, pest and disease models. So, for the Purdue Mesonet, that audience may be specialty crop growers utilizing those tools that are instructing what and how they spray their crops, or even when they should be thinking about planting or harvesting. We could create better tools if we have a higher-quality, spatially dense network across every county.”
Meeting attendees worked to brainstorm avenues of financial support from state government and key stakeholders.
“This meeting proved we have great partnerships around the state and outside of Indiana,” Hall said. “We are looking forward to growing these partnerships and our network in the near future.”

Growing clouds in a lab to study the science of far-away skies,"summarize:Info for journalists
Note to journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Alexandria Johnson does hard science on the most nebulous of subjects: clouds. As an atmospheric scientist and assistant professor of practice in Purdue University’s College of Science, she studies clouds wherever they are: in her lab, on Earth, throughout the solar system and into the galaxy.
“The coolest thing about my research is that I can see clouds every day,” Johnson said. “I can look up into our own atmosphere and watch them change and evolve. Then I can take that knowledge and apply it to other planetary bodies, both within and outside our solar system.”
The science of clouds covers a lot of ground. Her research shines light into topics ranging from the rainfall and microplastic precipitation in Indiana to the climates of moons and planets far outside the realm of human experience.
Studying clouds in their natural environments can be complex and subject to the variations of climate, weather and observation devices. Johnson’s solution is to create her own homegrown clouds to study in her lab in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. She strips the systems down to their basics to get a clear understanding on how the particles that make up clouds form, develop and interact with their environment. Nothing in her lab actually looks like a cloud; there are no mists swirling picturesquely in glass bottles. It’s mostly lasers and big black boxes. But the behavior of these lab-based cloud particles mimics the behavior of cloud particles in massive sky-sweeping clouds, only in miniature.
“Of course, we don’t grow them at quite the same scale you see in an atmosphere,” Johnson said. “Instead, we can take one particle that is representative of a cloud, pump in different gases, and change the temperature and pressure of the system. We then watch as that particle grows, shrinks or changes phase with time, which are processes that happen in clouds everywhere.”
Clouds on Earth don’t often form without the aid of a nuclei, or a particle, and in some cases what would be considered a nuclei on Earth may be an exotic cloud elsewhere. The particles in Johnson’s lab, like all particles, have a charge. Johnson and her team use an electric field to levitate and contain the individual particles so that they can’t move around. These particles are then stable for extended periods of time, which enables long-term research experiments, where the pressure, temperature, electric field and laser illumination may be tweaked, and observations recorded. Other methods build upon these to allow the team to look at groups of particles and observe how they scatter and polarize light.
Using methods like these, Johnson can study how clouds form and what different cloud particle shapes and compositions can reveal, and she is able to understand the conditions that lead to different cloud types and behaviors. Like aeronautical engineers using a wind tunnel to observe how currents move around structures, Johnson uses these particles to understand the microphysics that underpin vast and complex systems.
Many scientists – climatologists, meteorologists and planetary scientists, to name a few – study clouds as part of their broader research. But Johnson is one of the few who studies the particular physics of clouds in the laboratory.
“There are not many of us who dig into the microphysics of how clouds form,” Johnson said. “Anyone who studies the atmosphere has a general sense of knowledge about clouds. But none of those systems work without the physics. We have to understand the microphysics to truly grasp the complexities and implications.”
It’s a long-running joke that the nights of notable astronomical events on Earth seem to be almost supernaturally disposed to be cloudy. That is true of other planets, too.
Using enormous, advanced, vastly powerful telescopes, astronomers can peer through miles and light-years of space just to find clouds blocking their view of the planet itself. Rather than the planet’s surface, they can only perceive the opaque atmosphere that enswathes it.
Every planetary body in the solar system that has a dense atmosphere, and many outside of it, has clouds in that atmosphere. Even bodies with thin, wispy or intermittent atmospheres – like Pluto – have particulates hanging in the atmosphere that, while not true clouds, are a haze of particles and share many of clouds’ properties.
“Clouds are a ubiquitous feature of planetary atmospheres,” Johnson said. “This is something we’ve seen from our own solar system, and when we look at exoplanet atmospheres, it’s no surprise that we find clouds there too. Unfortunately, they tend to block our view of the atmosphere that is below.”
Scientists have been able to send probes and rovers to close planetary neighbors, including Venus and Mars. But for bodies that are farther away, including exoplanets – planets in other star systems entirely – scientists must come up with clever ways to conduct science.
“The astronomers find the clouds to be an annoyance. They get in the way of the data they want, whether that’s learning about the surface of the planet or its atmospheric composition,” Johnson said. “We see it a little differently. Yes, they’re there. We can’t get rid of them. So let’s use our understanding of clouds on Earth and planetary atmospheres of our solar system to learn about these things that we can’t observe in exoplanets.”
Most of the planets Johnson studies are “cool” planets. While Earth seems balmy (with planetary temperature averages around 60 degrees Fahrenheit), it is actually chilly by planetary standards, when contrasted to large, gas giants orbiting close to their stars like hot Jupiters.
Johnson and her team accumulate information about planetary bodies in Earth’s solar system or exoplanets. Astronomers can collect spectrographic data to analyze the chemical compounds that make up the atmosphere and use mathematical models, observations and gravitation studies to determine a planet’s mass, speed and orbit. Combining that information with insights from her laboratory studies, Johnson can help astronomers determine what a planet’s atmosphere might be like and extrapolate its chance for hosting life.
“Our big questions are when, where and why do clouds form in these atmospheres?” Johnson said. “If we want to understand these enshrouded exoplanets, we need to understand the clouds. That understanding gives us insights into the atmospheric chemistry at work, atmospheric circulation and the climate. In a way we ground-truth astronomical observations.”
Johnson is also looking up at the clouds from below, a little closer to home. In a current study, she is examining the role microplastics play in cloud formation. Microplastics pollution, which has been found just about everywhere, including large bodies of water like the Great Lakes, may form a part of clouds or be scavenged by precipitation, then shower the landscape in rainstorms and snowfall. Those microplastics have dire implications for ecosystem health, human health and agriculture.
Understanding how they become attached to clouds, move through weather systems and impact the landscape when deposited can help Johnson and her team protect life on Earth, just as they explore the possibility of livable conditions on other planets.
“It’s the same physics,” Johnson said. “It’s the same processes, all throughout the universe, and it brings me a huge amount of wonder and joy. As an undergraduate physics major, I chose a senior research project studying how water droplets froze under varying conditions. I literally watched a droplet freeze hundreds of times to study the process and was entranced. I said, ‘This is what I want to do with my life. This is amazing. I want to study clouds.’”

Purdue’s ‘talking concrete’ embedded into new I-465 and I-69 interchange in Indianapolis,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A Purdue University invention will soon give engineers real-time data from Indianapolis’ newest interstate section, potentially preventing potholes, reducing construction traffic jams and saving taxpayer dollars spent on road repairs.
Purdue researchers, Indiana Department of Transportation crews and WaveLogix installed concrete sensors invented by Purdue professor Luna Lu into the future I-465 interchange to I-69 south on Indianapolis’ south side on Tuesday (July 25). The sensor allows concrete to “talk,” decreases construction time and how often concrete pavement needs repairs, while also improving the road’s sustainability and cutting its carbon footprint.
The sensor was embedded directly into a concrete pour and sends engineers more precise, consistent data about the concrete’s strength and need for repair than is possible with currently used tools and methods. States across the country with concrete interstate pavement have signed up to participate in a Federal Highway Administration pooled fund study to try out the technology. Indiana joins Missouri, Tennessee and Texas in embedding the sensors.
More information about the sensors can be found here.
B-roll, sound bites and photos from the embedding on Tuesday can be found here.

Bringing the latest in medical technologies to the youngest patients,"summarize:INDIANAPOLIS and WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University, the Indiana University School of Medicine and medical device company Cook Medical are focusing a new alliance on clinical needs in pediatrics with a simple mantra: Infants and children are not scaled-down versions of adults.
The Crossroads Pediatric Device Consortium will focus on meeting unmet needs for pediatric patients by accelerating the development, approval and availability of innovative medical devices for children.
Engineer George Wodicka, the Vincent P. Reilly Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue, said there’s a tendency to think a technological solution for an adult medical problem can simply be scaled down to work for children.
“In reality that’s not the case,” he said. “Infants and children have different diseases and clinical problems. So, the research and development of pediatric devices is a distinct undertaking with a unique set of challenges.”
To address and overcome these challenges, the three foundational partners have launched the Crossroads Pediatric Device Consortium to more rapidly bring life-changing technologies to children in need. The consortium leverages the partners’ complementary expertise and long history of productive collaboration in the development of medical devices for adult patients. It brings to bear unmatched engineering research, pediatrics research and clinical care, and product development capabilities on the toughest of problems in pediatrics today.
Dr. Benjamin Gaston, the Billie Lou Wood Professor of Pediatrics at the IU School of Medicine and a pulmonologist at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, said the new initiative is an exciting model that physician scientists at the school and Riley Children’s Health can leverage to improve children’s health.
“Our jobs as IU School of Medicine faculty and IU Health doctors are to come up with solutions to the problems that our patients face, so this initiative is a seamless integration,” Gaston said. “The opportunity to collaborate with other experts at the intersection between engineering and medicine enhances our creative problem solving. There’s so much we can learn from each other about our respective fields; when you get everyone at the table talking, you get to a solution faster.”
Gaston said IU School of Medicine’s close alliance with Riley Children’s Health, which provides care to patients in 19 communities across Indiana, will connect consortium researchers with state-of-the-art inpatient and outpatient facilities that supply a pathway for sharing research-based solutions with Indiana kids.
Foundational partner Cook Medical, a major medical device company headquartered in Bloomington, Indiana, will provide the alliance with expertise in such areas as product design, regulatory approval and manufacturing.
“There is a huge need and opportunity to develop more options for pediatric care. We know that less than 12% of the National Institutes of Health budget funds pediatric research, and less than 10% of all health care spending is for pediatrics,” said Blayne Roeder, senior director, corporate development at Cook Medical. “Cook has experience creating devices with pediatric indications, and we know the prestige of Purdue and IU’s research, so this is a collaboration we’re excited to join. With expertise from all three organizations, we have more resources and more bright minds to innovate new technologies for this underserved patient population.”
Historically, few technologies developed for infants and children leave the laboratory, and those that do often fail commercially due to the relatively limited market size as compared to devices for adult patients. Cook Medical will help bridge the gap between academia and industry by collaborating with Purdue and IU School of Medicine innovators throughout the entire product development life cycle to identify the most efficient path to market and accelerate the translation of their innovative ideas to the clinic.
The Crossroads Pediatric Device Consortium is expected to open doors to new creative biomedical engineering solutions that impact children’s lives. It has already attracted interest from additional clinical and company partners with complementary expertise that would increase even further the breadth of childhood diseases that could be impacted.
Wodicka said integrating the expertise of each partner will help change the product development model, creating an opportunity to take on an expanded set of clinical needs and reduce the steps and time needed to bring pediatric devices to doctors and hospitals.
For project decisions, investigators will weigh in with perspectives and expertise from each side to determine the most pressing clinical needs that the consortium can work to overcome collaboratively.
“There are challenges that have faced pediatricians for decades that, up until now, were almost overwhelming for us to consider,” Wodicka said. “But now we’re positioned to tackle those through our collective strength.”
These expanded efforts will build momentum for the planned institute for engineering in medicine between Purdue and IU School of Medicine that will bolster Indiana’s position as a hub for innovations in health research and patient care.

The Indiana Sheep Association is one of the state’s oldest livestock organizations. It was originally founded as the Indiana Wool Growers Association in 1876 to encourage local shepherds to come together to share ideas and expertise, to promote lamb and wool in the state, and to educate communities about the value of sheep and the sheep industry.
The Indiana Sheep and Wool Market Development Program was created to support educational, promotional and research efforts involving sheep in Indiana. Funds for the council are collected from the sale of all sheep in Indiana – 0.5% of the net market price of each sheep sold. All funds collected by stockyards, sale managers, producers and others should be sent to the council’s business office at Purdue. See https://indianasheep.com/checkoff.php for more information.

"Longtime leader of Purdue’s international programs announces retirement, search launched for successor","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – In leading Purdue’s international programs for 14 years, Mike Brzezinski helped expand the university’s leadership role as a global institution in spearheading a major enrollment surge of international students.
Today, Purdue ranks among the nation’s largest public universities in international student enrollment and has become a leading innovator in higher education for its recruitment strategies, notably for undergraduate students and study abroad programs.
After three decades holding several key leadership roles in international programs, partnerships and student recruitment, Brzezinski announced today (July 24) that he will retire from Purdue, effective Aug. 31. He first came to Purdue in 1993.
Since January, Brzezinski has served as vice president of global partnerships and programs in the Office of the President.
Brzezinski, who was appointed Purdue dean of international programs in 2011 after serving two years in an interim capacity, deployed the university’s first formal international student recruitment strategy in 1995, which sparked a major enrollment surge in students from abroad, particularly among undergraduates.
In response, international enrollment of undergraduate and graduates reached record levels, including nearly 9,400 students representing 135 countries for Fall 2022 — the most ever. And while it plateaued during the global COVID-19 pandemic, Purdue’s overseas student enrollment  remains strong — it’s up from 8,651 international students a decade ago and places the Big Ten institution near the top among the nation’s largest public universities.
As dean of international programs, Brzezinski also expanded the Study Abroad Intercultural Learning grant program and spearheaded a multiyear, multimillion-dollar study abroad scholarship program that led to a near doubling of undergraduate student participation in Purdue’s study abroad efforts.
Study abroad participation at Purdue jumped to nearly 2,500 students in 2018 , before the COVID-19 pandemic, from fewer than 1,300 undergraduate students in 2012.  Student participation rates are rebounding nicely, Brzezinski said.
“I will always cherish my many years here,” a grateful Brzezinski said. “I had many opportunities to not only recommend but to implement new ideas and initiatives that I like to think benefited students, faculty and staff alike. I’ve always had great staff working for and with me, staff who were willing and able to meet every challenge. The successes that we have experienced over the years would not have been possible without their dedication and hard work.”
Purdue administrators say Brzezinski’s ability to work well with alumni and friends overseas, especially in Asian countries and throughout the Middle East, proved beneficial not only for Purdue students but Indiana businesses as well. Fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Brzezinski was one of the first American citizens to be a foreign exchange student in Beijing from 1981-83.
During his time at Purdue, Brzezinski also led the launch of the Center for Intercultural Learning, Mentorship, Assessment and Research In 2016. Known as CILMAR, the center has grown to become the premier intercultural learning office among R1 research universities as measured by assessment of intercultural growth of students participating in study abroad programs, research productivity and conference presentations. Through CILMAR, intercultural learning outcomes and assessment have been infused into all aspects of study abroad, and these are starting to be integrated into on-campus curricula, too.
Related to CILMAR, Brzezinski was instrumental in establishing the Intercultural Learning Hub, an online hub known as HubICL that hosts one of the world’s largest repository of intercultural learning activities and research findings.
More recently, Brzezinski led Purdue’s Ukrainian Scholars Initiative, which was launched in response to Russia’s February 2022 invasion of the Eastern European country. The Purdue program, regarded as one of the first and now the largest and most ambitious university-led program in the United States, offers the opportunity for Ukrainian scholars whose lives have been displaced by the war to continue their academic pursuits. It was expanded this spring to build on the current class of nine Ukrainian scholars who have been at Purdue since May 2022.
Brzezinski joined Purdue in 1993 as director of International Students and Scholars and became co-leader of the international student recruitment strategy in 1995. He served in this role until 2005 when he was named associate dean with additional duties focused on expanding educational collaborations in China.
Brzezinski worked at the University of Houston for five years as an international student counselor while he simultaneously earned his doctorate in educational leadership and cultural studies there in 1993. He earned master’s and bachelor’s degrees from State University of New York College at Cortland in 1983 and 1979, respectively.
From 1983-88, Brzezinski was central administrator and English language instructor in Beijing for an American educational company, Educational Services Exchange with China Inc., and then international student counselor at the University of Houston from 1988-93. He also studied in China, for two years as an exchange student.
Additionally, he has served as a consultant for Florida International University, St. Peter’s College, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, University of Las Vegas-Reno, Temple University, and University of Iowa.
A reception in Brzezinski’s honor is scheduled from 3-5 p.m. Monday, Aug. 28, at the bridgeway between Hovde Hall’s first floor and Elliott Hall of Music. A short program will begin at 4 pm. To RSVP, contact Lacretia Rothenberger at larothenberger@purdue.edu.
An internal search for the next Vice President for Global Partnerships and Programs is underway. Tenured and globally experienced Purdue West Lafayette faculty interested in shaping the mission, vision and strategy of Purdue’s future global agenda are encouraged to apply here. The application deadline is Aug. 15.

"CHL program to focus on taking control of type 2 diabetes, prediabetes","summarize:As part of the Healthy Boiler Program’s physical health pillar, the Center for Healthy Living (CHL) on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus offers a 14–week diabetes program multiple times throughout the year.
Taking Control of My Diabetes (TCMD) is open to all benefits-eligible employees (and dependents covered on a Purdue health plan) from West Lafayette, Purdue Northwest and Purdue Fort Wayne. The program is geared toward those living with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes or those supporting someone with a diagnosis. The next session begins Aug. 9.
The 14-week virtual lifestyle management program covers a variety of topics related to type 2 diabetes and prediabetes with a goal of equipping participants with the knowledge and resources needed to manage the disease as best as they can. Through the program participants will understand what diabetes is and how lifestyle changes are part of managing blood glucose.
A pre- and post-program evaluation to measure knowledge and beliefs as well as satisfaction with the program are required.
Participants have access to the center’s health care professionals, including CHL pharmacists who are specially trained in medication therapy management, as well as the program’s co-leaders: Cheryl Laszynski, RN health coach at the CHL, and Megan Shidler, registered dietitian at the CHL.
Eligible participants will receive a glucose meter and test strips to check their blood glucose levels. Program participants can continue to receive glucose testing supplies post-program if they continue to meet with a health coach on a monthly basis.
Many past TCMD participants have seen improvement in their A1c (a blood test that measures a patient’s blood glucose level over the past three months) and more.
Bruce Novak, a limited term lecturer at Purdue Fort Wayne who has lived with type 2 diabetes for over 10 years, shared that his experience with the course was exceptional and he benefited from the increased and reinforced knowledge he gained.
“Diabetes does not go on vacation,” he said. “The more you learn and apply, the better off you are. Diabetes is a constant battle.”
The upcoming session runs Aug. 9 to Nov. 8. Those interested in participating should register by Aug. 2 via the Healthy Boiler Portal. A registration link can be found under the “Healthy Boiler Workshops” section on the portal’s home page. Hover over the “Taking Control of My Diabetes” square and hit “Submit” to register.
“I would highly recommend this class to any diabetic or someone who has been diagnosed as prediabetic,” said Leigh Ann Griffin, senior quality advisor of the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering. She has lived with type 2 diabetes for approximately 20 years and previously participated in the TCMD program.
“I decided that I could benefit from a refresher course of ‘how to act like a diabetic’ by eating and cooking healthy and could use all the assistance I could get with motivating me to exercise. And I didn’t even have a working blood glucose meter anymore, and this class was giving us one for free! So, I signed up. Knowledge is power, and this class provides you with much-needed knowledge to properly manage your diabetes.”
Healthy Boiler workshops and lifestyle programs are free to all benefits-eligible faculty and staff and their dependents.
Individuals living with type 1 diabetes are able to meet monthly with a health coach but are not required to participate in the 14-week TCMD program to take advantage of the test strips and blood glucose meter opportunity. Contact the CHL at 765-494-0111 for more information.
Questions about the TCMD wellness program should be directed to the CHL at 765-494-0111.

"Reducing speed limits, increasing safety on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
To improve safety on and around Purdue University’s West Lafayette campus, the university and the city of West Lafayette are reducing speed limits for various roads and streets, effective no later than the beginning of August.
Purdue Administrative Operations engineering staff and the city’s public works department partnered to explore and now implement the following speed limit reductions:
Cherry Lane from the entrance of the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex to Northwestern Avenue: 40 mph to 30 mph.
Cherry Lane from McCormick Road to the entrance of the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex: 45 mph to 35 mph.
McCormick Road from Cherry Lane to Stadium Avenue: 45 mph to 35 mph.
McCormick Road from Stadium Avenue to Mitch Daniels Boulevard: 35 mph to 30 mph.
Airport Road from Mitch Daniels Boulevard to U.S. 231: 35 mph to 30 mph.
Mitch Daniels Boulevard from Martin Jischke Drive to Memorial Mall Drive: 30 mph to 25 mph.
Grant Street from Mitch Daniels Boulevard to south of Williams Street: 30 mph to 25 mph.
Martin Jischke Drive from Harrison Street to U.S. 231: 30 mph to 25 mph.
The university and city recognize that lower vehicle speeds lead to safer pedestrian movements. Purdue University Police chief Lesley Wiete says safe pedestrian movements are critical on a large college campus like Purdue.
“With a campus population of 60,000 during the academic year, pedestrian safety is a top priority for our department,” Wiete said. “The risk of severe injury or death for a pedestrian struck by a vehicle increases with the speed of the vehicle, so we fully support lowering the speed limits in these areas.”
The reduced speed limits have been approved by the West Lafayette Traffic Commission. They will go into effect as construction along Cherry Lane continues. The plans call for the realignment of Cherry Lane to accommodate the new Pete Dye Clubhouse and the construction of a multi-use trail.
“With the scale of the changes occurring along Cherry Lane, we ask that the public be mindful of their surroundings and circumstances now and when the roadway reopens in the coming weeks,” said chief Troy Harris of the West Lafayette Police Department. “The reduction of vehicular speed, along with beginning to separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area, will help enhance safety long-term.”
The new speed limit signs are being installed over the coming weeks, and installation will be complete by the beginning of August. Motorists should always obey all posted speed limit signs and use caution on and around campus.
Pedestrians can also take actions to ensure safety while traveling on and around campus. More information about pedestrian safety is available on the Transportation Services website.
Administrative Operations supports the university through safe, reliable and transformative services. Reducing speed limits to increase safety and overall wellness for the campus community is just one of many ways the organization powers Purdue.","[{'summary_text': 'the university and the city of west Lafayette are reducing speed limits for various roads and streets . the new speed limit signs are being installed over the coming weeks, and will be complete by the beginning of august .'}]"

Roth in-plan conversion option now available within voluntary retirement plan,"summarize:As of June 23, the 403(b) voluntary plan – an employee voluntary retirement savings option – now offers active faculty and staff a Roth in-plan conversion feature.
This newly expanded retirement provision allows active faculty and staff the ability to convert their previously contributed pretax dollars into a designated Roth account within the same plan.
Currently, the 403(b) voluntary plan allows employees the choice to contribute on a pretax basis and/or Roth after-tax basis. Pretax contributions are payroll-deducted from eligible pay and lower the employee’s taxable income when made. Any earnings from pretax contributions accrue tax‐deferred, and the employee pays taxes when the contributions and earnings are withdrawn from the account, typically at retirement age.
By contrast, Roth contributions are payroll-deducted from eligible pay after taxes are taken and do not lower an employee’s taxable income. Any earnings on Roth contributions accrue tax‐free, and the employee pays no taxes when the Roth contributions and earnings are withdrawn in the future, provided the employee is at least age 59 ½ or disabled and their withdrawal is made at least five years after their first Roth contribution.
A Roth in‐plan conversion offers the chance to build tax‐free retirement income and may help employees manage their future tax liability. There is also a cost to the conversion to be aware of as any amount converted is treated as taxable income in the year of conversion.
Roth in-plan conversion benefits:
A potential tax savings strategy for individuals who expect their tax rate to be higher in the future.
Provides additional savings flexibility within the plan by allowing the option to diversify retirement assets between pretax and after-tax accounts.
Additional items for consideration:
Plan to keep the money invested for at least five years after the conversion before taking a withdrawal.
Have the ability to pay the tax on the applicable Roth in-plan conversion in the year of the conversion.
The decision to convert pretax funds to Roth is optional and a complex decision that should be discussed with a Fidelity retirement planner and/or an employee’s financial or tax advisor to ensure all factors are considered. Additional FAQs are available here.
Fidelity is offering a“Ask Fidelity: What is a Roth In-Plan Conversion?” virtual session. Your retirement plan offers many ways to save for the future. Participants will learn more about their options, including how to convert after-tax dollars to a Roth using an in-plan conversion. A sessions is available on the following date and time:

Currently, the 403(b) voluntary plan allows employees the choice to contribute on a pretax basis and/or Roth after-tax basis. Pretax contributions are payroll-deducted from eligible pay and lower the employee’s taxable income when made. Any earnings from pretax contributions accrue tax‐deferred, and the employee pays taxes when the contributions and earnings are withdrawn from the account, typically at retirement age.
By contrast, Roth contributions are payroll-deducted from eligible pay after taxes are taken and do not lower an employee’s taxable income. Any earnings on Roth contributions accrue tax‐free, and the employee pays no taxes when the Roth contributions and earnings are withdrawn in the future, provided the employee is at least age 59 ½ or disabled and their withdrawal is made at least five years after their first Roth contribution.
A Roth in‐plan conversion offers the chance to build tax‐free retirement income and may help employees manage their future tax liability. There is also a cost to the conversion to be aware of as any amount converted is treated as taxable income in the year of conversion.
Roth in-plan conversion benefits:
A potential tax savings strategy for individuals who expect their tax rate to be higher in the future.
Provides additional savings flexibility within the plan by allowing the option to diversify retirement assets between pretax and after-tax accounts.
Additional items for consideration:
Plan to keep the money invested for at least five years after the conversion before taking a withdrawal.
Have the ability to pay the tax on the applicable Roth in-plan conversion in the year of the conversion.
The decision to convert pretax funds to Roth is optional and a complex decision that should be discussed with a Fidelity retirement planner and/or an employee’s financial or tax advisor to ensure all factors are considered. Additional FAQs are available here.
Fidelity is offering a“Ask Fidelity: What is a Roth In-Plan Conversion?” virtual session. Your retirement plan offers many ways to save for the future.

"Purdue Innovates Startup Foundry awards $200,000 in equity investment to Aerovy Mobility and Uniform Sierra Aerospace","summarize:Purdue Innovates Startup Foundry, which helps startups prepare for venture investment, awarded $100,000 apiece to Aerovy Mobility and Uniform Sierra Aerospace, two Purdue-affiliated startup companies.
The investments were awarded as part of Startup Foundry’s biannual Black and Gold Awards pitch competition. Up to $1 million total in equity investments was available during the Black and Gold competition. Entrepreneurs from 11 startups made pitches; judges could award between $30,000 and $100,000 to each company.
Aerovy Mobility also received $40,000 from the New Venture Challenge pitch competition. The competition is managed by the Purdue Innovates Incubator, which provides resources to de-risk Purdue-related startups and early-stage technology.
Tyler Mantel, director of Startup Foundry, said a startup’s initial investments provide a strong foundation that a company builds upon.
“These investments can move a startup forward by funding product-market fit and hiring first employees, but their impact goes beyond that,” Mantel said. “Initial investments are a sign to other prospective investors that these companies are investment-worthy, which could lead to follow-on investments and growth.”
Justin Renfrow, director of the Incubator, said de-risking companies and technologies creates long-term benefits.
“De-risking includes tasks like clarifying customers’ problems, performing market validation and detailing a business model,” Renfrow said. “These take time, but taking those steps helps companies grow to the stage where they are ready to take on significant outside investment.”
Aerovy Mobility provides cloud solutions for airlines and airports to prepare for and manage electric aviation. Nick Gunady and Seejay Patel, graduate students in Purdue’s College of Engineering, founded the company. Aerovy has been supported since incorporation in September 2022 by the John Martinson Entrepreneurial Center. Gunady said the Startup Foundry investment represents a significant milestone in Aerovy Mobility’s effort to enable the future of electric aviation.
“The funds will be used to launch our cloud-based live operations tool, VEMS, at vertiports and airports around the world,” Gunady said. “This investment from Purdue is a major vote of confidence from a major brand in aerospace toward our pre-seed round.”
Aerovy Mobility anticipates several milestones in the next 12 to 18 months.
“These include development of critical intellectual property and worldwide deployments of our cloud-based software tools for electric aviation planning and management,” Gunady said.
Uniform Sierra Aerospace is a drone manufacturer for public safety departments. Purdue alumni Duncan Mulgrew, Trevor Redpath and Jeremy Frederick founded the company. Mulgrew said the Startup Foundry investment will aid Uniform Sierra Aerospace’s fundraising efforts.
“It has been challenging to raise venture capital, given the vast majority of funds are exclusively focused on business-to-business SAAS (software as a service) companies,” Mulgrew said. “Having the backing and the name Purdue in our raise has helped us both to get the money we need for the current stage and trajectory of the business and to close some other investments faster.”
Mulgrew said Uniform Sierra Aerospace is moving into a new production facility in the Purdue Technology Center, a business incubator in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette.
“This will allow us to greatly improve the production rate of our aircraft,” Mulgrew said. “Right now, manufacturing speed and space are our largest limiting factors; this will be a massive improvement for us. We are on track to deliver more than 32 full systems to users this year.”
The next Black and Gold Awards competition is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2023. The competition is industry-agnostic; Purdue-connected startups across all industry sectors are encouraged to apply.
Purdue Innovates Startup Foundry helps startups prepare for venture investment. The team works with early-stage startups looking for their first money in and prepares them to raise their first seed round. This is done by offering early-stage funding, entrepreneur-in-residence support, enhanced pitch coaching, graphic design services and an emphasis on increasing traction. Startup Foundry supports two pitch competitions. The Black and Gold Awards invest $30,000 (Black Award) and $100,000 (Gold Award) in Purdue-affiliated startups. Ag-Celerator invests up to $100,000 into Purdue-affiliated startups with connections to the agriculture industry. Investments are awarded each semester. Startup Foundry also works closely with Purdue Ventures to support its portfolio companies and ensure coaching and advice mirrors what the investor network needs.

"Reducing speed limits, increasing safety on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
To improve safety on and around Purdue University’s West Lafayette campus, the university and the city of West Lafayette are reducing speed limits for various roads and streets, effective no later than the beginning of August.
Purdue Administrative Operations engineering staff and the city’s public works department partnered to explore and now implement the following speed limit reductions:
Cherry Lane from the entrance of the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex to Northwestern Avenue: 40 mph to 30 mph.
Cherry Lane from McCormick Road to the entrance of the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex: 45 mph to 35 mph.
McCormick Road from Cherry Lane to Stadium Avenue: 45 mph to 35 mph.
McCormick Road from Stadium Avenue to Mitch Daniels Boulevard: 35 mph to 30 mph.
Airport Road from Mitch Daniels Boulevard to U.S. 231: 35 mph to 30 mph.
Mitch Daniels Boulevard from Martin Jischke Drive to Memorial Mall Drive: 30 mph to 25 mph.
Grant Street from Mitch Daniels Boulevard to south of Williams Street: 30 mph to 25 mph.
Martin Jischke Drive from Harrison Street to U.S. 231: 30 mph to 25 mph.
The university and city recognize that lower vehicle speeds lead to safer pedestrian movements. Purdue University Police chief Lesley Wiete says safe pedestrian movements are critical on a large college campus like Purdue.
“With a campus population of 60,000 during the academic year, pedestrian safety is a top priority for our department,” Wiete said. “The risk of severe injury or death for a pedestrian struck by a vehicle increases with the speed of the vehicle, so we fully support lowering the speed limits in these areas.”
The reduced speed limits have been approved by the West Lafayette Traffic Commission. They will go into effect as construction along Cherry Lane continues. The plans call for the realignment of Cherry Lane to accommodate the new Pete Dye Clubhouse and the construction of a multi-use trail.
“With the scale of the changes occurring along Cherry Lane, we ask that the public be mindful of their surroundings and circumstances now and when the roadway reopens in the coming weeks,” said chief Troy Harris of the West Lafayette Police Department. “The reduction of vehicular speed, along with beginning to separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area, will help enhance safety long-term.”
The new speed limit signs are being installed over the coming weeks, and installation will be complete by the beginning of August. Motorists should always obey all posted speed limit signs and use caution on and around campus.
Pedestrians can also take actions to ensure safety while traveling on and around campus. More information about pedestrian safety is available on the Transportation Services website.
Administrative Operations supports the university through safe, reliable and transformative services. Reducing speed limits to increase safety and overall wellness for the campus community is just one of many ways the organization powers Purdue.","[{'summary_text': 'the university and the city of west Lafayette are reducing speed limits for various roads and streets . the new speed limit signs are being installed over the coming weeks, and will be complete by the beginning of august .'}]"
"Diesel engine research leading to better efficiency, emissions standards on the roads","summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University’s Greg Shaver doesn’t believe there should be a trade-off between protecting the air we breathe and achieving better engine efficiency of large vehicles on the road.
Shaver, a mechanical engineering professor and director of Purdue’s Ray W. Herrick Laboratories, is part of a national effort researching the reduction of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and microscopic particle emissions and improving the efficiency of diesel engines on the road today.
Diesel engines are in everything from large pickup trucks and delivery vehicles to semitractor-trailers. Almost all semis, Shaver said, run on diesel engines.
“There was this expectation even two years ago that you have to trade off nitrogen oxide and particulate matter with carbon dioxide because the work to make the diesel engine cleaner would also make the engine less efficient, resulting in more carbon dioxide,” Shaver said. “But what we’ve shown in our work at Purdue – through support from, and collaboration with, the U.S. Department of Energy and industry leaders Cummins Inc. and Eaton – is there is advanced technology that can be used to improve these important engine and after-treatment systems.”
Shaver’s research has enabled diesel engine efficiency and emissions control through variable valve actuation, or VVA. Heavy-duty vehicles often idle or move slowly, creating increased smog emissions.
Shaver’s VVA allows for increased efficiency of diesel engines, also called compression ignition engines, by utilizing cylinder deactivation and other methods during engine idling, low-load operation and highway cruise conditions. VVA also enables the faster warmup of catalysts for effective reduction of an engine’s nitrogen oxides and microscopic particle emissions.
The diesel engine research at Purdue has resulted in important attention recently from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In December, the EPA finalized stringent new tailpipe emissions requirements for trucks, based in part on research done by Shaver and his team at Herrick Labs.
“Affecting the finalization of more stringent environmental regulations for heavy-duty engines and vehicles is probably the greatest kind of impact that someone with my research focus can have,” Shaver said.
Shaver said the EPA tailpipe emissions regulations will take effect in 2027.
“That’s when the engines have to start meeting these requirements, which seems like a long way away, but it really isn’t,” he said. “There’s a lot to do to make these engines work robustly and meet these requirements and demonstrate them.”
It’s the second time Shaver’s work has been pulled into truck guideline decisions. His work was cited in landmark regulation passed in California for on-road heavy-duty trucks in 2020, focused on reducing tailpipe nitrogen oxide emissions.
Shaver’s research at Herrick Labs extends back to 2006 and is part of ongoing collaborations with the U.S. Department of Energy and industry leaders including Cummins Inc., Caterpillar, Deere, Allison and Eaton. These efforts are focused on off- and on-road high-efficiency natural gas, hydrogen and diesel engines – including those incorporated as part of a hybrid electric power train.

"High-rise structure efficiency, completion time look different thanks to SpeedCore composite modules","summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue engineers are taking building possibilities to new heights with the university’s role in the research and development of an innovative high-rise construction process.
Amit Varma, Purdue’s Karl H. Kettelhut Professor of Civil Engineering, began work on the steel and concrete composite construction system, called SpeedCore, almost a decade ago with the technique’s creator, Ron Klemencic of the engineering firm Magnusson Klemencic Associates. Klemencic is a Distinguished Alumni honoree who earned his bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from Purdue in 1985.
Rainier Square, a 58-story building in downtown Seattle, was honored this year and in late 2022 for its use of SpeedCore, which cut construction time by 10 months, or close to 40 percent.
The SpeedCore research resumed a topic of interest for Varma dating back to his doctoral degree, which was based on columns using the same steel and concrete composite system.
“You could say that it was the little brother of the steel and concrete composite SpeedCore wall system. I always felt that it was an amazing idea, and it’s time would come someday,” said Varma, director of Purdue’s Robert L. and Terry L. Bowen Laboratory for Large-Scale Civil Engineering Research.
SpeedCore essentially resembles a concrete sandwich, with parallel steel plates connected by metal rods in the space between the plates. The steel modules can be fabricated off site and brought into any construction layout and connected as needed. Concrete is then poured into the space between the steel plates, making the composite steel-concrete-steel sandwich system.
The earliest work on SpeedCore was in 2006 and funded at Purdue. At the time, Varma said an application for the construction process hadn’t been realized. Klemencic and Varma’s involvement brought potential use of SpeedCore into the realm of high-rise structures with early plans to use it on the planned 58-story Rainier Square building.
Varma worked extensively at Purdue to research some of the major safety aspects SpeedCore deals with at the central core of a high-rise building. High winds and earthquakes can cause varying levels of swaying that require a solid interior core to maintain the building’s safety.
“In addition to earthquake resistance, we also have looked at the fire resistance of this system because of the steel plates,” Varma said. “There’s always the question of what fire is going to do to such a construction. So we’ve done actual testing and analysis and developed earthquake-resistant and fire-resistant design equations for the system as well.
“The behavior of steel structures under fire can be improved drastically by having a composite structure like SpeedCore because concrete does not heat up as fast. It creates a heat sink, and it provides stiffness to the steel structure. So composite construction like this is another way to get good fire resistance for a building.”
Varma received several awards, including the 2021 T.R. Higgins Lectureship Award from the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC), for his work on SpeedCore. Varma and his graduate students have published numerous journal articles and recently authored a Design Guide, published by AISC in 2023 for the SpeedCore systems.
There are additional plans for high-rise buildings using SpeedCore this year and in the future.

"Purdue Center for Regional Development to support NSF Engines initiative, evaluate regional impact","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue Center for Regional Development, as part of the Office of Engagement, has been awarded a one-year contract from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)  to establish the framework and process to evaluate the impact of the first-ever NSF Regional Innovation Engines (NSF Engines) competition. The NSF Engines program is a federal grant program intended to stimulate innovation-driven economic growth in every U.S. region, with special attention to underperforming or disadvantaged regions.
The PCRD will work with NSF to develop a robust evaluation framework. This will allow NSF to assess the growth of awarded NSF Engines and gain insights into the program’s impact across the country.
“PCRD is going to be a critical NSF partner to evaluate the impact of the NSF Engines program,” said Roberto Gallardo, vice president for engagement and director of the Purdue Center for Regional Development. “NSF’s objective is to create impactful and sustainable regional engines. With our contribution to the evaluation process, we’ll be helping to tell a powerful story of the impact this program will have across regions in the country.”
Erwin Gianchandani, NSF assistant director for technology, innovation and partnerships, said, “Data and evaluation frameworks are key to determining the success of transformational programs like the NSF Engines. Through this contract, NSF will ensure the NSF Engines program is successfully harnessing the geography of innovation and that the U.S. remains in the vanguard of competitiveness well into the future.”
Gallardo named vice president of the updated Office of Engagement

The NSF Engines program was authorized in the “CHIPS and Science Act of 2022” and aims to strengthen American manufacturing, supply chains and national security, including by investing in research and development, science and technology, and the workforce of the future.
It aspires to catalyze robust partnerships among universities, nonprofits, businesses, state, local and tribal governments, and other organizations, to create positive economic impact within a geographic region to advance national competitiveness and create local, high-wage jobs.
“This program is a bold new initiative aimed at significantly expanding the country’s innovation capacity by investing in key areas of national interest and economic promise in every region of the U.S.,” Gallardo said. “The Purdue Center for Regional Development’s proven experience with regional development, applied research, and data analysis will allow us to examine the successes resulting from the NSF Engines program.”
In June, NSF selected 34 semifinalists for the program and is now assessing these semifinalists to gauge the viability of their projects; their ability to mobilize in the first two years; their competitive advantages; and budget and resources for their planned research and development, translation and workforce development efforts. NSF has described plans to publish a list of finalists later this summer. Each NSF Engine could receive up to $160 million over 10 years.
PCRD will create benchmarks, guidelines and metrics that final recipients will be required to follow to illustrate the effectiveness of the NSF Engines program while aligning with engine-specific evaluation efforts. The NSF Engines span nearly all key technology and societal and economic challenges highlighted in the “CHIPS and Science Act,” including advanced manufacturing, advanced materials, microelectronics and semiconductors, and sustainability, among others.
“As a land-grant university, ensuring regional and national economic prosperity is a core part of our public service mission,” said Karen Plaut, executive vice president of research. “Through the Purdue Center for Regional Development, we are honored to partner with NSF to develop a rigorous framework for measuring the impact of R&D on regional economic growth.”
Gallardo said the initial contract calls for PCRD to develop the evaluation process and training materials.
“The National Science Foundation is a critical partner of Purdue, as it accounts for one-fourth of all federal research expenditures at Purdue, supporting research efforts across all fields,” said Alyssa Wilcox, senior vice president for partnerships and chief of staff. “This partnership reflects Purdue’s capacity not only to innovate but also to measure and document the regional impacts of innovation.”
In addition to the NSF Engines project, the PCRD is part of an academic team evaluating the impact of the Biden administration’s $1 billion Build Back Better Regional Challenge, which aims to boost economic recovery from the pandemic and rebuild American communities, including those grappling with decades of disinvestment. The program is administered through the Economic Development Administration, an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce.

There is a spot behind the greenhouses for the perennials and pots of plants that can be used to help add color and interest to events and celebrations, such as graduation ceremonies.
The work begins long before the plants are planted. Seeds are purchased in the fall for the next year and stored in a dark, cool environment.
Germination for about 40,000 plants then begins the second or third week of January. Inside the greenhouse is a germination chamber draped with clear plastic. The plastic covering helps control the chamber’s humidity and temperature. The seeds are put into germination trays that have long narrow cells filled with soil. The trays are then placed on electric heat mats within the chamber to control the temperature of the soil within the trays. Additionally, each of the trays is covered with a domed plastic cover to provide greater control of the microclimate of the germinating seed and the seedling once it begins to grow.
“It definitely takes the specific knowledge and experience our greenhouse staff have because different seed types require different soil temperatures. This helps gain the best germination rate of the sown seed,” says Phil Richey, director of Grounds.
The seeds are then taken care of at the greenhouse as they grow into the mature plants – including flowers – that will be planted in beds and landscapes throughout campus. The planting starts in late April or early May and is not finished until mid-June. At the end of the calendar year, the plants are harvested out of their beds and composted. It’s a process that saves the university money.
“Seed and plugs purchased each year are under $5,000. It’s definitely more cost-effective, compared to the nearly $25,000 it would take to purchase the same number of flowers ready to plant,” Richey said. “Purchasing seeds also allows for a greater diversity of plant type and varieties.”
When it comes to pesticides and fungicides, Richey said the Grounds department does not use any in its greenhouses. Two years ago, the greenhouse staff switched to using beneficial insects. The staff found the insects to be very easy to distribute, and they were more cost-effective and eco-friendlier. The quality of the plants has not diminished since the change, Richey said.
“Our department thoroughly enjoys this work,” Richey continued. “It’s really rewarding to see months and months of work pay off when campus is bright with color and all our beds are full and thriving.”
The Grounds department is part of the Administrative Operations organization. The organization supports the university by providing safe, reliable and transformative services. Finding cost-effective ways to help keep campus beautiful and lively is just one of many ways Administrative Operations powers Purdue.","[{'summary_text': 'the grounds department works year-round to keep campus looking its best . a greenhouse is used for perennials and pots of plants that can be used to help add color and interest to events and celebrations, such as graduation ceremonies . two years ago, the greenhouse staff switched to using beneficial insects .'}]"

Purdue Animal Sciences selects Hattie Duncan as livestock judging coordinator,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
After a yearlong search, Purdue Animal Sciences has selected Hattie Duncan to lead its livestock judging team as well as the department’s newly formed livestock judging program. Duncan is a Wingate, Indiana, native who was raised on a Hereford cattle farm.
After earning her master’s degree in animal sciences from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Duncan lectured on beef production, animal ethics and introductory animal sciences courses at the university. She comes to Purdue with extensive experience in livestock judging from both sides of the arena, having assisted in the organization of several judging events for Illinois 4-H.
John Blanton, professor and department head of Animal Sciences, said Duncan’s talent and motivation for livestock judging will enable the newly formed judging program within the department to flourish. The program will include introductory judging experiences for first-year students so they can determine if joining Purdue’s teams would be the right fit for them.
“Coming in as freshmen, students will get their first experiences with judging in our classes with live animal evaluation and learn to write out their reasoning and arguments,” Blanton said. “Having Hattie as our livestock judging coordinator will also allow for better recruiting and hiring of judges, putting Purdue on the path to win a national championship.”
Duncan said her decision to return to Indiana is one that she will utilize in her recruiting processes.
“I was a student who was passionate about agriculture and specifically livestock, and I left the state,” she said. “I think there are a lot of people who found themselves in the same boat as me. So I think it’s really important we work to keep our in-state students here by providing opportunities for them to become the future leaders of Indiana agriculture.”
One of the major perks Duncan hopes to replicate for Purdue students is the networking opportunities that come from being involved with judging teams.
“It is common during off weekends for competitors to take a group trip to a livestock operation to judge their animals as practice,” Duncan said. “These excursions allow for students to meet so many important people to help in advancing their careers.”","[{'summary_text': 'Hattie Duncan is a Wingate, Indiana, native who was raised on a hereford cattle farm . she comes to Purdue with extensive experience in livestock judging from both sides of the arena .'}]"
Soybean industry to benefit from growing demand of cell-cultured meat,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The prospect of increased demand for cell-cultured meat is expected to positively impact the soybean industry, according to a new paper from Holly Wang, professor of agricultural economics, at Purdue University.
Published in the department’s Purdue Agricultural Economics Report (PAER),  Wang’s collaborators are Shihuan Kuang, professor of animal sciences, and graduate students Yanyu Ma and Yizhou Hua.
The paper, titled, “The Rise of Meat Substitute Consumption and Its Impact on the U.S. Soybean Industry,” predicts that the demand for soybean consumption will rise due to the wider availability of meat substitutes or plant-based meats. Their research finds that the sales of plant-based meat in the U.S. has increased by 56% from 2018 to 2021.
Among new meat substitutes is cell-cultured meat, an industry that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture recently approved to enter the U.S. market. Through their findings, Wang and her collaborators conclude that this industry has the potential to change the way we produce and consume meat.
“Lab-cultured meat products are already sold and consumed in the world, with some produced and supplied by U.S. firms. Domestically, lab meat just received major government approval, and so it can move very fast to the market,” Wang says. “Mass production is expected right around the corner.”
Wang specifically references a cell-cultured meat firm, Upside Foods Co. With products already produced and sold commercially in Singapore, the company is one of the largest cultured meat producers in the country. The company has plans to introduce a cultured chicken product into the U.S. market in 2023.
The paper details that during the lab production of cell-cultured meat, soybeans can be the primary source for protein hydrolysates, the necessary nutrient used to help cells grow into “meat.” Also, the soybean to cell-cultured meat ratio is high, therefore, lab-cultured meat could create a high demand for soybeans.
The authors acknowledge  concerns about high prices, restrictive taste and appeal, and the potential artificial nature of the lab-product. Still, previous peer-reviewed studies have shown that one in three Americans are not averse to sampling lab-grown meat.",[{'summary_text': 'sales of plant-based meat in the u.s. has increased by 56% from 2018 to 2021 . cell-cultured meat is an industry that the fda and the dda recently approved to enter the us market .'}]

“Pilotsmith is very excited to join Purdue Global in this partnership. Providing more educational options for students is always a winning formula,” said Trent VandenHeuvel, vice president of Pilotsmith.
Students who complete all five flight certifications/ratings — private pilot certification, instrument rating, commercial pilot certification, certified flight instructor and multiengine flight rating — will receive 45 college credits from Purdue Global toward their bachelor’s degree in professional flight, equivalent to one year of college credits. Students who have college credits from previous schools may also receive additional transfer credits, thereby saving them more money and allowing them to graduate faster.
“We are pleased to join forces with an established flight training center like Pilotsmith to bolster our popular professional flight program,” said Sara Sander, Purdue Global vice president and dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences and interim dean of the School of Aviation. “The benefits to our students training under Pilotsmith are the significant cost savings and speed to obtaining the five flight certificates and ratings required within our professional flight program. Students can realistically accelerate their path to the airlines by one or two years.”
Pilotsmith students, employees and immediate family members (spouse, domestic partner, children, siblings and parents) are eligible for a tuition incentive package for undergraduate and graduate degrees and certificates.
Purdue Global’s professional flight degree program is a collaboration between Purdue Global and Purdue University’s School of Aviation and Transportation Technology. The collaboration, which was announced in 2019, combines the quality of Purdue’s legendary aviation program with the flexibility and affordability that Purdue Global offers.
As U.S. airline pilots approach the federally mandated retirement age of 65, the industry faces a shortage of pilots.

Emotional Freedom Technique: Research supports benefits of tapping for mental health,"summarize:Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as “tapping,” is a method that some individuals have found helpful in managing their emotions. During EFT, individuals tap certain points on their body – similar to the points used during acupuncture. Tapping was first introduced in the 1990s by Gary Craig, a Stanford graduate and certified master practitioner of neurolinguistic programming.
An article titled “What Is Tapping for Anxiety?,” provided by BetterHelp, gives details on the practice.
In November 2022, the Tapping School shared an article titled “Why tapping should be avoided: Are the rumors true?” In short, the article debunks the myths surrounding avoiding tapping as a method to help certain behavioral health issues and concerns. Furthermore, the article shares details on what EFT is, what it can help with and how individuals can make EFT tapping work for them.
The Tapping School reports research showing that EFT can help with certain conditions, including:
Anxiety
Anger
Depression
Stress
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Additionally, EFT International’s Free Tapping Manual, a comprehensive guide that introduces EFT, provides even more ways EFT can be helpful, including:
Improving some types of physical pain
Fostering better sleep and sleep patterns
Diminishing cravings
Maximizing creativity
Improving performance
There are apps available to help individuals with EFT, including The Tapping Solution, which is available to download in the App Store and Google Play. Individuals can also research EFT more and/or talk with a counselor or therapist about the method and whether it would be helpful for them to implement into their self-care practices.

"Jim Bullard, president of St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, appointed inaugural dean at Purdue’s Daniels School of Business","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The longest serving sitting president of Federal Reserve Banks and one of the nation’s foremost economists and respected scholar-leaders has been chosen to lead the continued transformation of the reimagined Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business (DSB) at Purdue University. James “Jim” Bullard on Thursday (July 13) was named the inaugural Dr. Samuel R. Allen Dean of the Daniels School of Business with a start date of Aug. 15.
Bullard, who spent the last 15 years as the sitting president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, has earned significant praise and accolades for his long-standing leadership and innovative thinking as part of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in guiding the direction of U.S. monetary policy. A noted economist and scholar, Bullard had been the longest-serving Federal Reserve Bank president in the country and ranked as the seventh-most influential economist in the world in 2014. His scholarly impact has been based on research-based thinking and intellectual openness to new theories and explanations. That has allowed Bullard to be an early voice for economic change, helping the Federal Reserve deftly navigate complex economic landscapes such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial crisis during his tenure.
“Dr. Bullard has been an extraordinary leader for our country and will be a transformational leader of Purdue’s Daniels School of Business. His track record has the perfect combination of national impact, scholarly excellence, and innovative leadership through 15 years as President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “Today’s exciting recruitment is a singular, extraordinary moment for the future of DSB and the tech-driven, free-market economy.”
Purdue’s next big move: The Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business
White Family Foundation commits $50 million to new Daniels School of Business at Purdue University
Alumnus and wife give $10 million in unrestricted support to Purdue’s new Daniels School of Business
Before becoming president in 2008, Bullard served in various roles at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, starting in 1990 as an economist in the research division and later serving as vice president and deputy director of research for monetary analysis. For the last 15 years, Bullard has directed the activities of the Federal Reserve’s Eighth District, which branches into several states, including an extensive portion of southern Indiana. While serving on the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee, Macroeconomic Advisers named Bullard the FOMC’s second biggest mover of markets in 2010 behind Chairman Ben Bernanke and the biggest mover of markets in 2011 and 2013.
To further reflect and to maximize the impact of Dr. Bullard’s unique, national leadership experience, he is also appointed as Special Advisor to the President of the university, reporting to President Chiang in that capacity.
“I am humbled and beyond thrilled to be asked to lead the Daniels School of Business, named for one of the most influential fiscal leaders of our time,” Bullard said. “Purdue is known around the world for forward-thinking innovation. I will work to foster that spirit, and I think I can bring some real-world experience to pass on to the next generation of business leaders and innovators. I share Purdue’s vision to build toward the economies of the future, and I can’t wait to get started.”
Bullard will be charged with inspiring, further developing and implementing Purdue’s reimagined approach to a top-ranked business school across undergraduate, graduate,  executive and research programs, preparing tomorrow’s business leaders and entrepreneurs in the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business that is grounded in the principles of free enterprise, free market economy in generating opportunities and prosperity, and in the hallmarks of a well-rounded Purdue education and with a particular emphasis on tech-driven, analytics-based business success. Aspired to become a top 10 business school in the country, the Daniels School of Business will extend Purdue’s land-grant mission to provide affordable and accessible education at the highest quality, and the primary thought leader between the coasts as a top public research university.
“Jim’s experience base, credentials and perspective are exactly the right match to enhance scholarly excellence and develop globally leading thinkers at our Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business,” said Patrick J. Wolfe, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity at Purdue. “His visionary leadership will take the Daniels School of Business to new heights while building on current Purdue strengths and deepening the impact of our other two key strategic priorities: Purdue Computes and Purdue University in Indianapolis. I am extremely grateful to our Transition Steering Committee and to all who contributed to this search and its stellar outcome.”
Following an extensive, international search since December 2022, with multiple extremely qualified candidates, Bullard earned a unanimous vote from the Transition Steering Committee (TSC), co-chaired by Gary Lehman, vice chair of the Purdue University Board of Trustees, and Kevin Mumford, the Kozuch Director of the Purdue University Research Center in Economics and professor of economics, and consisting of faculty and alumni representatives. That recommendation was accepted by President Chiang and Provost Wolfe, officially appointing Bullard as the leader to chart the future of business education and research at Purdue University.
“We are thrilled to have Jim Bullard leading the transformation of the Daniels School of Business,” Lehman said. “We evaluated many fantastic candidates during this process, but Dr. Bullard’s exemplary record as a scholar and business leader cemented him as our top choice.”
Launched in February, the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business has pursued three prongs in its execution: recruiting talents, securing resources, and developing strategies. In terms of resources, the Board of Trustees announced internal investments, such as 50 new tenure-track faculty positions and additional lines for other type of faculty and fellow appointments, as well as a campaign for DSB with a $200M target. The campaign has generated momentum within months, including multiple significant gifts. The Dean and Barbara White Family Foundation gave $50 million to establish the Bruce White Undergraduate Institute inside the school. Honoring Bruce White (M ’75), the founder and chairman of White Lodging, a former member of the Purdue Board of Trustees and one of the most prominent Boilermakers, the Bruce White Undergraduate Institute serves as a flagship of DSB, alongside and parallel to the long-standing Krannert Graduate Institute. In April, longtime Purdue University benefactors Norman (LA ’65, MA ’66, HDR ’95) and Karen (EDU ’65) Blake committed $10 million toward the creation of an ethics center within the Daniels School of Business. Another $10 million commitment from Gerald (CE ’64, MS ’71) and Nanette Lyles pledged unrestricted support for the Daniels School of Business. Marshall (MS ’77) and Susan Larsen provided the $10 million gift to create the Larsen Leadership Academy in the School. Tom Howatt (M ’72, MS ’73) pledged a significant gift on Purdue Day of Giving in April. These and other generous gifts, coupled with Purdue’s own hefty investment for facility expansion and talent recruiting, has underlined the university’s commitment to making the Daniels School of Business the foremost business schools in the nation for a tech-driven, free market economy, through new academic programs, innovative learning opportunities and top-notch faculty recruits with excellence at scale.
“As an innovative thinker and transformative business leader himself, there is no one better than Jim Bullard to lead the way for the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business,” said Mike Berghoff, chair of Purdue’s Board of Trustees. “This decision is yet another step toward creating a business school that is world-renowned and universally respected.”
During his time as an academic economist and financial policy scholar, Bullard’s research has appeared in premier journals, including the American Economic Review; the Journal of Monetary Economics; Macroeconomic Dynamics; and the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking.  Bullard served as an honorary professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis, where he also sat on the advisory council of the economics department as well as several advisory boards. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch named him the Top Workplace Leader among the region’s large employers as part of its 2018 Top Workplace Awards. Active in the community, Bullard has served on the board of directors of Concordance Academy of Leadership in St. Louis and was formerly the board chair of the United Way U.S.A. He is co-editor of the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, a member of the editorial advisory board of the National Institute Economic Review and a member of the Central Bank Research Association’s senior council.
Born in Wisconsin, Bullard grew up in Forest Lake, Minnesota, and received his doctorate in economics from Indiana University in Bloomington. He holds Bachelor of Science degrees in economics and in quantitative methods and information systems from St. Cloud State University in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

"Purdue researchers receive $118,000 to develop freeze-drying, meat validation and thermal imaging innovations","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University researchers with patent-pending innovations for the agriculture, medical and autonomous transportation industries have received funding to further develop their work and bring it to the marketplace.
Researchers from the Bindley Bioscience Center and the College of Engineering have received more than $118,000 from the Trask Innovation Fund to make their work more attractive for commercial use.
The fund is managed by the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization. It awards up to $50,000 for short-term projects that enhance the commercial value of intellectual property. The application deadline for the next round of funding is Sept. 22.
The spring 2023 Trask Innovation Fund recipients, their projects and award amounts are:
Alina Alexeenko, College of Engineering, “Mobile Modular Demo Unit of Tunable RF Heating for Biologics Processing,” $25,000
Christina Ferreira, Bindley Bioscience Center, “Muscle Biomarkers to Discriminate Characteristics of the Meat,” $43,600.
Zubin Jacob, College of Engineering, “VGA Interface for High-Speed Thermal Imager at Room Temperature,” $50,000.
Alexeenko and her collaborators are using microwaves to make lyophilization, or freeze-drying, faster and more cost-effective in the transportation and storage of vaccines, injectable drug products and reagents for molecular diagnostics. The innovation could expand the use of the process and increase the availability of vaccines and biopharmaceuticals with a long shelf life not requiring frozen storage. Alexeenko is co-founder and co-director of LyoHUB, a university-industry center that improves freeze-drying technology to make food, pharmaceuticals and biotech products safer and more affordable.
“The Trask grant will allow us to design and build a mobile demonstration unit for RF heating for lyophilization that could be transported to potential industry users for on-site testing,” Alexeenko said. “Our goal is working with our commercial partner LyoWave Inc. to get early testing by industry on real products and de-risk the adoption of this new pharmaceutical manufacturing technology.”
Ferreira and her collaborators at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil have developed a method to determine the type of feed provided to cattle. Grass-fed beef has been recognized as healthier than grain-fed beef, but there is no method to independently validate a grass-fed claim. The researchers’ patent-pending method allows for a fast, accurate approach to determine beef quality and meet certification requirements.
“The funds will create a prototype of a system that can certify meat quality inside a large meat plant without sample preparation within a few seconds. The system makes it possible to determine if cattle have been grass- or grain-fed and if the meat is tender,” Ferreira said. “The team, which will include graduate students from Purdue’s Department of Animal Sciences and Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, will be able to collect valuable meat samples at the Boilermaker Butcher Block to test the prototype.”
Jacob and his research team are building a “thermal voyager,” the world’s first autonomous navigation agent that exploits ambient heat radiation signals for perception. Intelligent machines must perceive their environment and make real-time decisions for a range of tasks. However, conventional sensors provide little visibility in the nighttime and under harsh conditions like smoke or fog. Infrared radiation detectors work during the night as well as in low-visibility conditions, but these sensors do not have the size, weight, power and speed requirements needed for autonomous navigation.
“The next-generation, patent-pending detectors developed by my team have the potential for disruptive impact in the thermal imaging market,” Jacob said. “The Trask award will provide the crucial funding necessary to develop infrared thermal sensors to be mounted on the thermal voyager.”
Abhijit Karve, the Office of Technology Commercialization’s director of business development, said the Trask Innovation Fund awards strengthen a researcher’s ability to move research past the “valley of death.”
“The path to deliver an academic discovery to the marketplace can take a long time to travel because of the many challenges involved,” Karve said. “The Trask Innovation Fund complements other Purdue Innovates resources to assist innovators in developing products viable for industry commercialization. Trask Innovation Fund awards have been used for additional validation for these researchers’ work, including developing prototypes, conducting tests and generating data.”
Alexeenko’s, Ferreira’s and Jacob’s innovations, and other innovations created by Purdue researchers across all academic disciplines and campuses, are available for further development and licensing. Contact otcip@prf.org for more information.

"Amplified Sciences receives $400,000 NCI grant to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Health care providers and their patients could know with greater confidence whether pancreatic cysts are benign or potentially malignant, and if surgery is required to remove them, by using a new diagnostic test currently in development.
Amplified Sciences, a clinical-stage life sciences diagnostic company that licenses Purdue University innovations, has received a Phase I Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, grant of approximately $400,000 from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to develop the test. The company focuses on accurately detecting and categorically assessing the risks of debilitating diseases.
CEO Diana Caldwell said the incidental detection rate of cystic pancreatic lesions has increased significantly due to the aging population and advances in clinical imaging technologies. However, there is a lack of definitive diagnostics to accurately assess if a cyst is benign or potentially malignant.
“Health care professionals need better tools to help them manage these patients and identify individuals most at risk for pancreatic cancer,” Caldwell said. “Pancreatic cysts are a window to early detection and represent an important risk factor in identifying pancreatic cancer early.”
Caldwell said clinicians must balance the risk of missing a potentially malignant cyst with taking unnecessary surgical action to remove a benign cyst. She said retrospective studies have found almost one-fourth of surgeries to remove pancreatic cysts are unwarranted.
“However, previous studies have also revealed that when clinicians use a wait-and-see approach to monitor the development of pancreatic cancer, up to a quarter of patients receive surgery too late,” Caldwell said. “The dual-edged nature of this process highlights the need for better early-stage diagnostic tools.”
Caldwell said the NCI grant will help fund important technical and clinical validation milestones, including the procurement of banked patient samples and clinical trials.
The company’s pancreatic cancer diagnostic products are based on technology invented by V. Jo Davisson, professor of medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacology in Purdue University’s College of Pharmacy and a faculty member of the Purdue Institute for Drug Discovery. Davisson serves as the chief scientific officer of Amplified Sciences.
“This award recognizes the strength of our scientific team, the potential of our chemistry platform and the National Institutes of Health’s interest in supporting early-stage diagnostics in this disease state,” Davisson said.
The state of Indiana is also supportive of startups earning SBIR grants. Through a program managed by Elevate Ventures, the company is eligible for a Phase I grant match of up to $50,000.
Amplified Sciences licenses Davisson’s intellectual property through the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization.
Amplified Sciences is a clinical-stage life science diagnostics startup focused on detecting and preempting the risks of debilitating diseases, thus providing health providers the ability to treat patients earlier with better outcomes.

Preventing traffic accidents to the moon and back,"summarize:Info for journalists
Note to journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
With dozens of missions headed to the space between Earth and the moon over the next 10 years, there’s bound to be traffic.
To prevent those spacecraft from running into each other, Purdue University engineer Carolin Frueh is investigating how to observe and keep track of all human-made objects and predict the impact of their potential damage in this Earth-moon neighborhood, called the cislunar region.
According to Frueh, a Purdue associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics, the reality is that solutions for space traffic in the cislunar region will be moving targets. The methods she is developing are intended to adapt to this region as traffic changes.
“There will never actually be a final answer to a space traffic management problem because as the commercial sector grows and the capabilities and types of vehicles that you have change, the problem will evolve, too,” she said. “So when we think about the techniques that we want to use, we also have to be sure that what we have in mind can evolve over time.”
The economic potential of cislunar space is estimated to be more than $30 billion over a 20-year period, taking into account government investment, demand for space telecommunications services and other factors.
At 238,900 miles, the distance between the Earth and the moon is 18 times longer than the Great Wall of China. That might seem like enough room for spacecraft to move around without hitting each other, but the cislunar region is far less understood than near-Earth orbits, which extend 24,000 miles beyond Earth’s surface up to a “sweet spot” called the geosynchronous region that enables satellites to keep pace with Earth’s rotation. Near-Earth orbits are home to most satellites. Famous residents of that area include the Hubble Space Telescope and International Space Station.
Even with more knowledge of near-Earth orbits, approximately 130 million pieces of space debris surround Earth. Much of this debris has broken off satellites that exploded or collided with other objects. Debris has already made it to the moon: A rogue rocket booster crashed onto the lunar surface last March.
To address forthcoming traffic in cislunar space, Frueh has been pulling from her research on how spacecraft become debris. She works with space agencies around the world to improve databases of space objects.
Doing the same for cislunar space will be difficult without being able to see as much of that larger region. For near-Earth orbits, telescopes in space and to a limited extent telescopes on Earth are among the “traffic cameras” for satellites. But there aren’t any telescopes in the cislunar region because there isn’t much satellite activity to observe yet. Space-based telescopes would be better at tracking cislunar satellites when more of them populate that area because ground-based telescopes can only detect a satellite of interest in cislunar space if the satellite, moon and Earth are aligned exactly right.
Together with her student, Surabhi Bhadauria, Frueh is developing a way to create “visibility maps” that would show the best regions telescopes should use to find and track human-made objects in cislunar space — including active satellites, dead satellites and fragments of satellites.
Compared to other approaches, these maps better address a big challenge with surveilling the cislunar region: space is always changing. The constantly moving positions of the Earth, moon and sun affect what a telescope observes at any given moment and which orbits it can use to see spacecraft well. Current mapping methods must re-run a model for each condition that would affect a telescope’s orbit and overall viewing geometry at each instance in time, which is computationally intensive.
Frueh’s visibility maps run on models that more quickly and comprehensively indicate where telescopes should go to observe as much of the cislunar region as possible. The maps allow for seeing more of a region by averaging out all the orbits a telescope might use rather than integrating each orbit change over time like other mapping methods have to do. Frueh’s method also doesn’t require any additional computational time to show which satellites can be observed under which conditions from various locations.
“It’s like planning a road trip. Right now, we have identified points of interest in the cislunar region to observe with telescopes, but we haven’t found the route yet for putting the telescopes there,” Frueh said.
Even when telescopes are eventually put into the cislunar region, satellites will likely just look like white dots or streaks in the images these telescopes capture. But Frueh is used to gleaning meaningful information from these shapes in telescope images of satellites in near-Earth orbits. She’s working on a method that would allow researchers and mission planners to discern the orbits that a satellite is using to do its mission. The method would be designed to work under a range of scenarios – even when very little is known about the satellite.
Since it’s inevitable that traffic accidents will happen in cislunar space, Frueh also is thinking ahead on how to estimate the damage an accident could cause. If a collision or explosion happens, where do all the pieces end up?
Her research indicates that pieces from a fragmented satellite can travel long distances in a relatively short amount of time. She and her student, Ariel Black, recently presented a study at the 2023 AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting showing these pieces can travel effortlessly all the way back to Earth from deeper into cislunar space.
“We are laying the foundations that we believe will shape how space traffic management problems are addressed in the cislunar region,” Frueh said.

‘This is a comeback that’s really mine’,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
As the daughter of an officer in the U.S. Air Force, Danielle Finch (BS nutrition ’23, Purdue Global) always wanted to enlist herself, but not until she was done with her bachelor’s degree. That would enable her to begin as a commissioned officer, which offered the workload and pay that would work best for someone with a family to support.
But things didn’t go to plan. She and her husband became parents before she could finish her bachelor’s degree, and she withdrew from classes. After a few years and another baby, career instability and a failing marriage rattled her family, so she attempted to stabilize the situation by enlisting early.
Finch overcame those obstacles, as well as a deployment, to earn her degree. She received her degree during Purdue Global’s May 2023 commencement.
“For me, having my bachelor’s degree keeps the door open. If I want to be a registered dietitian, I can. But another one I’ve thought about is health care administration; I could go that route, too,” she says. “I’m not quite sure how I’m going to use it yet. But I had to take this dream of what I wanted to do and decide I was going to own this. And this is mine.”

Reminder: New salary tier for medical benefits in effect; no change on 2023 benefit premiums for current employees,"summarize:As of July 1, 2023, the new salary tier for medical benefit premiums will be $50,250 (increased from $48,800). This means that new employees hired July 1 and after will be charged medical premiums based on whether their salary is above or below $50,250.
As merit increases take effect for current employees in July, it’s important to note that all benefit premium rates are frozen in Benefitfocus. Therefore, benefit deductions for current employees will not change for the remainder of the 2023 calendar year.
Any employees whose merit increase takes them above the $50,250 annual salary tier will not see an increase in premium deductions until January 2024.
Benefit deduction rates for Jan. 1-Dec. 31, 2023, are based on employee salaries as of Oct. 17, 2022.
As a reminder, annual merit increases allow an opportunity to review other benefits and consider making adjustments, for example, to voluntary retirement savings or health savings accounts. Increasing retirement contributions by as little as 1% can make a big difference on an employee’s retirement savings and current tax withholding.
Pay increases also result in increased retirement contributions from the university. To make changes to voluntary retirement contributions, employees can log in to Fidelity or call 800-343-0860.

Purdue University ascends to the top 10 of the Global University Visibility rankings,"summarize:WASHINGTON, D.C. —
Purdue University has once again attained international acclaim, earning a top-10 spot among the most prominent and recognized universities worldwide in the Global University Visibility (GUV) rankings.
In the rankings, conducted by the Washington, D.C.-based firm American Caldwell, Purdue is the only university from the state of Indiana to make the list, coming in at No. 3 among U.S. public universities and No. 10 globally, and ahead of institutions such as the University of Cambridge, Yale University and UCLA. The rankings track the annual visibility of each university through a variety of metrics to compile an overall score, providing a comprehensive measure of a university’s prominence within a 12-month period. One hundred universities were listed.
“This latest affirmation of Purdue’s renowned reputation worldwide should not come as a surprise to anyone,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “It is exciting for Purdue to be recognized for excellence at scale, as we continue to strive to be the most consequential public university in creating, disseminating and deploying knowledge in areas making the most significant difference in society.”
Global University Visibility Rankings
Purdue scores top 10 among U.S. public universities in latest QS world rankings
Purdue University named No. 16 among World’s Most Innovative Companies, No.1 in education
The top-10 GUV rankings placement is the latest among the multitude of national and global recognitions Purdue University has compiled in recent months. Last week, Purdue earned a top-10 among U.S. public universities in QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) world rankings. Purdue also was ranked in the top 10 public institutions in the 2022 Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education rankings. As a top-10 Most Innovative school nationally for five years running (U.S. News & World Report) and a top-four in patents received in the U.S., numerous Purdue academic programs – including two colleges – consistently rank among the nation’s best. Purdue has also been selected in both the last two years by Fast Company magazine as a Brand That Matters, and made Fast Company’s list of the world’s most innovative companies (No. 16 – ahead of the likes of NASA and the Walt Disney Co. – and the only university listed).
In a new year with a new leader in President Chiang, Purdue has continued to collect significant accolades while also riding the momentum of the Daniels decade under former President Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr.  Under Daniels, the university transformed higher education’s landscape and demonstrated the vital role universities can play in fostering economic development and success at the local, state, national and global level.
“First, our global visibility no doubt benefited greatly from President Emeritus Mitch Daniels’ leadership during the last decade. From there, with a terrific product, we work to enchant audiences with amazing stories about real people at Purdue University persistently pursuing and delivering practical solutions to today’s toughest challenges,” said Ethan Braden, executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer at Purdue University. “Our marketing and communications team and community are excellent and expert at telling the stories that speak to the heart of Purdue’s brand, helping Purdue earn this distinguished placement in the GUV rankings.”
The Global University Visibility (GUV) ranking provide a new perspective, acknowledging that public visibility is intrinsically linked to the prestige and prominence of a university, a connection previously unaddressed by traditional metrics. The GUV ranking incorporates six key indicators, including the frequency and quality of universities’ media appearances, the online footprint, social media following, public interest level, web citations, and website visitors. By placing emphasis on these factors, the GUV ranking aspires to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of a university’s global visibility. Purdue University earned strong marks in all categories, including nearly 15 million visits to Purdue.edu – the seventh most website visitors of any university – leading to its impressive placement among the world’s most recognized institutions.

Purdue researchers fabricate sensors with potential health-monitoring applications onto ready-made wearables,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A patent-pending method developed by Purdue University researchers brings the public one step closer to clothes with wearable electronics that don’t affect the wearer’s comfort. The method also simplifies the manufacturing process and boosts sensing capability.
Wearable electronics that monitor bioinformation like blood pressure, body temperature and respiratory patterns have become prominent in research. Traditional wearable devices such as health-monitoring systems, however, are hard and inflexible, which makes them difficult to wear for extended periods of time.
Furthermore, fabricating wearable sensors onto clothing creates different sets of problems, said Sunghwan Lee, assistant professor of engineering technology in the Purdue Polytechnic Institute. Traditional sensors eliminate fabric breathability, or the circulation of air from the inside to the outside. Breathability allows vapor moisture to diffuse, which prevents people from overheating and keeps them comfortable.
“This is significant especially when sensors have military or medical assistive rehabilitation applications,” Lee said. “People need to wear these electronics for long periods of time. It isn’t convenient to replace them in the middle of a rehab session or military exercise.
“These limitations are caused by the traditional method to fabricate sensors on clothing. It relies on either brittle and inflexible inorganic materials, which lack longer-cycle stability, or liquid-phase processing, which is unable to create conformal coating on fabrics and hence makes it difficult to secure the required breathability.”
Lee and his team have used a technique called oxidative chemical vapor deposition, or oCVD, to form highly conducting and mechanically flexible polymer films conformally coated on every thread of fabric. It controls the thickness of the polymer layer, called PEDOT, while maintaining the fabric’s breathability and flexibility.
Lee and his team demonstrated the method by directly depositing and patterning the PEDOT layer on commercially available disposable gloves and masks to create blood pressure- and respiratory rate-monitoring sensors. The team confirmed the mechanical flexibility of the conformally vapor-printed PEDOT layer through cyclic bending tests on fabric samples coated with various thicknesses of the films at different temperatures.
“Samples were bent 180 degrees to generate high stress and strain on the fabrics. Their electrical conductivity was measured every cycle,” Lee said. “The deposited layer was shown to maintain its conductive performance consistently for more than 100 bending cycles. This exemplifies excellent mechanical flexibility and resilience to bending and strain that typical wearable fabrics undergo.”
A breathability test determined that the fabric’s air permeability was not compromised by the coated PEDOT film. There was a negligible difference in breathability between bare fabric and an oCVD PEDOT-coated fabric; there also was no clear difference between oCVD PEDOT-coated fabrics of varying thicknesses.
“This consistent high breathability indicates the enhanced versatility of oCVD PEDOT for wearable devices, as film thickness can be adjusted per application without having to consider the effect on breathability,” Lee said.
A manuscript about Lee’s research was published in the October 2021 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances. He disclosed the innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for patent protection on the intellectual property.

"‘Baseball was my dream, and Purdue Global moved me forward’","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Juan Diego Montes Incer (BS health and wellness ’23, Purdue Global) remembers growing up in Guatemala City, watching the World Baseball Classic on the television with his mom. Someday, he told her, that was going to be him.
And in the spring of 2023, it was him, at age 27, playing in the Classic for his mom’s home country of Nicaragua.
With the unreachable dream reached, he felt it was time to round out his skill set because he knew who was watching. He’d once been a kid, watching his heroes on TV, and if they heard any message from him, he wanted it to be the fact that he was about to graduate with his bachelor’s degree from Purdue Global.
“Most players in Latin America either study, or they play baseball. I have to let children know that school is important,” he says. “We can do both. We don’t have to choose between them.”
In May, surrounded by family, he crossed the stage in West Lafayette to accept his diploma.
As he begins playing for a new team this season – the Tri-City Valleycats in Troy, New York – he looks to the years he has left on the field and beyond without worry because he has a degree that’s given him both the knowledge and the qualifications to start a new career once this one’s over.

"All new summer, fall 2023 undergraduate Purdue students to be issued mobile digital ID cards for greater campus convenience","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
All incoming Purdue University undergraduate students for the upcoming Early Start/Summer Start sessions and Fall 2023 semester will be issued Purdue Mobile ID — and not a physical identification card — as part of Purdue’s innovative move to a Mobile First ID system.
The effort coincides with this weekend’s start of Purdue orientation on Friday (July 7) for the fall semester for more than 700 incoming freshmen, ahead of the five-week Early Start and Summer Start sessions that run July 10-Aug. 11. The weeklong Boiler Gold Rush (BGR) orientation for incoming undergraduates is Aug. 15-19, with the fall semester beginning Aug. 21.
Since May 2, new Boilermaker students planning to come to the West Lafayette campus in the Summer and Fall 2023 semesters have had access to Purdue 101, which is the university’s required online orientation program for all incoming students, completed via Brightspace. Through Purdue 101, incoming students are guided through campus resources and information on course planning to help them make a strong start at Purdue. The online module can be done at any pace, but it must be completed before students can meet with an academic advisor.
“‘Mobile First’ is a strategy used by many universities, and at Purdue, all incoming new students for our Early Start/Summer Start sessions and the upcoming fall semester will be issued a Purdue Mobile ID, which will become their primary identification on campus,” said Loribeth Hettinger, senior associate bursar of ID Card Operations/Support.
“Physical ID cards, meantime, will be provided as an alternative to undergraduate students who do not have a smartphone device or if theirs is not compatible with Purdue’s new mobile credentials system. We want to stress that this major step in our just-launched Purdue Mobile ID initiative for students is ‘Mobile First,’ not mobile only.”

Transact Mobile Credentials
Video highlights ease of use of Purdue Mobile ID
Purdue’s ID Card Operations/Support, in partnership with Student Life and Purdue Information Technology, launched the new Purdue Mobile ID on April 19. Through Purdue Mobile ID, students can add their ID to Apple Wallet or Google Wallet and use their iPhone, Apple Watch or Android devices to access campus buildings, purchase meals and more.
Using Purdue Mobile ID, students can simply hold their device near a reader to access residence halls and campus buildings, make transactions using BoilerExpress, use their meal plans and even pay for laundry. The new Purdue Mobile ID for students is enabled for smartphones via Transact Mobile Credentials.
Since its launch, nearly 14,000 Purdue students have downloaded the Transact eAccounts app for using Purdue Mobile ID, including 4,203 new students enrolled this summer and 4,287 planning to attend in the fall.
Within the Mobile Credentials system launched as Purdue Mobile ID is a strategy called Mobile First, which calls for all new students beginning in summer and fall 2023 to have a mobile ID on their smartphones and smartwatches. Mobile First’s goal at Purdue is to eliminate the need for hard-copy ID cards for all 50,000 West Lafayette students over the next few years.
Physical ID cards, meantime, will be provided as an alternative to undergraduate students who do not have a smartphone device or if theirs is not compatible with Purdue’s new mobile credentials system. A $25 fee will be assessed for a hard-copy Purdue ID card, and a process is in place for students who can explain why the fee should be waived.
Graduate students also may need physical cards because some academic buildings, laboratories and other facilities will still require the physical Purdue ID card for access in the short term.
Faculty and staff on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus will continue to use physical IDs and are not participating in the Purdue Mobile ID program.
The move from physical cards to Purdue Mobile ID on iPhone, Apple Watch or Android devices allows for transactions that are safe, convenient and secure, and helps students avoid handing their ID cards to someone else. The mobile IDs also can be issued remotely, eliminating the need to print and mail physical cards and creating a safer, more cost-effective and more environmentally friendly process.
Purdue has been laying the groundwork to launch Transact Mobile Credentials since 2013, first by updating campus infrastructure for door readers and point-of-sale devices to be mobile-ready. Purdue is installing contactless and tap-to-pay technology using the Transact system through a phased approach across campus.

Biotechnology offers holistic approach to restoration of at-risk forest tree species,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Many at-risk forest tree species will probably need biotechnology along with traditional tree-breeding approaches to survive, according to insights published in the July issue of the journal New Forests.
Purdue University’s Douglass Jacobs and Kasten Dumroese of the U.S. Forest Service led a team of 19 co-authors, including scientists, land managers and regulators, in presenting their findings on biotechnological risk assessment and forest tree restoration. Their New Forests paper, published in a special issue on threatened tree species, presents key outcomes of a 2021 virtual international conference on the issues.
Among their conclusions: Society drives policy. If genetic engineering is the only way to save some species, its use will require public acceptance.
“Biotechnology is a diverse toolkit comprising different technologies that can be used to impart pest resistance – it could be bugs or pathogens – in our threatened forest trees,” said Jacobs, the Fred M. van Eck Professor of Forest Biology. But many people mistakenly equate biotechnology with genetic engineering.
“Traditional tree breeding, whether you’re breeding different species or different varieties within species, has been going on for thousands of years. And the regulations on planting trees that have been traditionally bred are wide open,” he said. “Genetic engineering, on the other hand, is highly regulated, but all biotechnology is certainly not genetic engineering.”
Scientists often use genomics, for example, which involves working with the complete set of an organism’s genetic material, to learn more about what causes disease. Genomics also can help identify the genes responsible for useful traits such as pest resistance.
Blight began afflicting the American chestnut in the 1900s, killing billions of trees. Despite being the target of decades-long tree-breeding efforts, the chestnut’s prospects remain in doubt. The list of at-risk species also includes ash, butternut, and bristlecone pine among other members of the five-needle white pine family.
“I feel a sense of urgency. We can’t take a hundred years like we’ve taken with chestnut to turn the page,” said Dumroese, a research plant physiologist at the Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Research Station in Idaho.
“The species are becoming ecologically extinct,” Dumroese said. “They’re not able to provide their historic level of ecosystem function because often they don’t grow to maturity. And that’s happening at a faster and faster pace. Look at how rapidly we’ve lost ash trees from our forests and urban landscapes because of the introduced insect pest emerald ash borer.”
The western white pine is an example of how the Forest Service has, starting in the 1960s, effectively used traditional tree breeding to cope with white pine blister rust. The white pine population remains below its pre-blister-rust levels, however, and may never become fully restored.
“But we see a lot more western white pine on the landscape and being planted on the landscape every year because of those efforts,” Dumroese said. “That process only took a couple of decades where we come from a big problem to making improvements. We need that pace for all of the species that we’re calling at risk.”
Back in Indiana, the Hardwood Tree Improvement & Regeneration Center, a joint effort between Purdue and the Forest Service, for years has maintained a breeding program for pest resistance. Almost all of the center’s efforts to date have focused on traditional tree breeding and genomics.
“The chance to work with chestnut and help reintroduce it back to the landscape was a big reason I took the Purdue job in the first place back in December of 2001,” Jacobs said. “Watching species disappear from the landscape provides me personally with a lot of motivation to contribute whatever I can toward helping to save some of these at-risk species.”
In the last 10 years, Jacobs has seen striking advancements in novel biotechnologies that use genomics and genetic engineering.
“For some species, traditional tree breeding doesn’t appear to be a viable long-term option to get disease-resistant trees. In those cases, it’s probably going to have to be genetic engineering if we want to save the species,” he said.
That applies even to a species like the blight-afflicted American chestnut, the target of a breeding program for 50 years. “Introducing enough chestnut and ash trees to bring us back to the pre-disturbance level is likely not possible in anyone’s lifetime, but you have to start somewhere,” Dumroese noted.
The participants of the 2021 conference came to a consensus on the applicability of biotechnology toward reintroducing some threatened forest tree species. They came from academia, the Forest Service, and organizations such as the American Chestnut Foundation and the Nature Conservancy.
“Societal perception and policy remain the weakest links,” Jacobs said. “There’s been this consistent one-way flow of information from scientists to the public with the idea of, ‘Hey, we’re scientists, trust us.’ Or ‘We’re the government, trust us.’ But you need a much more interactive dialogue to be successful in changing public opinion.”
Support for the conference and related work was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Kayli Peterson is driven to succeed,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
To race car driver Kayli Peterson, the art of the comeback isn’t an unfamiliar concept. Winning, falling behind and getting back on top is all just part of success.
“At one point we won like 20 or 21 races in a row. Some years are like that. When you’re clearly the best out there, you go out and you win every weekend,” says Peterson, who drives in NASCAR’s Super Late Model and Modified series. “But then you have the years when it just sucks; you don’t know what’s happening.”
The San Bernardino, California, resident grew up tightening bolts as a toddler with her dad – a driver and a mechanic himself – at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. But the early start didn’t grant her an easy path. She attributes her success to what she believes in: Want it. Find the problem and solve it. Don’t stop.
This way of thinking matters to Peterson in everything she does, whether she’s working toward trophies or a master’s degree in forensic psychology from Purdue Global.

Sociogenomics: The intricate science of how genetics influences sociology,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Humans contain multitudes. Each person on the planet contains enough DNA to stretch to Pluto – several times.
Studying how all this genetic material works, and especially how genes influence human behavior, is an enormously complicated undertaking – one that’s being made easier by the emergence of massive banks of genetic data and complex data science analysis techniques to parse that data.
Robbee Wedow, an assistant professor of sociology and data science in Purdue University’s College of Liberal Arts, an adjunct assistant professor of medical and molecular genetics in the Indiana University School of Medicine, and Purdue’s inaugural faculty-in-residence at AnalytiXIN/16 Tech in Indianapolis, maps those miles of genes for insights into how genetics interacts with social forces and environments. He uses genetic databases to study how tiny bits of genes called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, affect complex, overarching traits including sexual behavior, educational attainment, socioeconomic status, health behaviors and more.
“We know that social forces like socioeconomic status play a role in influencing a person’s life and life outcomes,” Wedow said. “But we also know there is a genetic component to every behavior. What we don’t understand yet is how these biological forces interact with the environment and what these sorts of interactions might mean for social science – and what we think we know about social science research to date. We are using well-powered genetic data to do more accurate and replicable social science and to explore what might be possible at the intersection of genetic and behavioral science.”
When scientists sequenced the first human genome in 2003, the true scale of genetics started to become apparent. Early geneticists thought that finding a gene for each trait was simply a matter of looking in the right place.
However, DNA bases and genes are not simply keys on a massive piano upon which human lives are played like masterpieces. Instead, DNA operates more like a pipe organ, where stops, switches and pedals can change the way notes sound, mute them or increase their volume. Environment, nutrition, pollution, life experiences and other circumstances can change when and how genes matter for certain outcomes, and even change which places in the genomes matter for those outcomes altogether. There isn’t a single gene for a behavioral outcome. Biology isn’t destiny: It may lay out the musical score, but musicians are free to improvise and interpret as they play.
The idea, Wedow stresses, is not that these genes control a person’s life or destiny. Each SNP, in fact, has a very small effect on an overall outcome like educational attainment. No “Gattaca”-level reading of one’s destiny from their genes – in the style of the dystopian 1990s movie – is on the horizon. Rather, being able to clarify the genetics of certain behaviors can help scientists understand the nuances of human behavior.
“People think that genetics is always about biology, but in the case of sociogenomics it’s more about using the advantages of this new, well-powered data to better understand the outcomes themselves, or about allowing researchers to do more accurate social science and behavioral research,” Wedow said. “The social sciences have recently struggled with replicating studies. Oftentimes the sample sizes are too small for rigorous estimates and certainty. That’s where the potential of using these huge banks of genetic data for the social sciences comes in. They help us get a much clearer, more certain look at what’s really going on.”
Analyzing the genetics is only the first step. An American geneticist in the early 1800s could have correlated genetics with educational mastery and concluded that anyone with two X chromosomes tended to have less education. That is not because the chromosomes had anything at all to do with education. Rather, the correlation reflected social and gender biases present in the culture at the time. Similar insights lurk in Wedow’s research.
“Sociogenomics isn’t necessarily about biology, like some might think,” Wedow said. “When someone studies cancer genetics, they are studying it because they want to elucidate the biology of cancer; they want to figure out ways to better diagnose it, track it and treat it. But researchers in the field of sociogenomics want to study the genetics in order to do better social science. No one would ever study sociology without considering socioeconomic status and environment. We want to be able to take genetics into account in the same way.”
In a study in volume 7, No. 7 of the journal Nature Human Behaviour, Wedow, his co-corresponding author Andrea Ganna from the University of Helsinki, and his other co-authors looked at 109 survey questions in over 300,000 individuals to examine the ways that people’s genes correlated with whether they answered certain questions or left them blank in surveys answered in the UK Biobank. That may sound fairly abstruse, but it fills a gap that the field of sociology has struggled with for decades.
“How do you know what you don’t know or how someone might have answered a question if they choose not to answer it?” Wedow said. “It turns out that the genetics of people who either answer the survey question, or do not, overlaps with the genetics of other outcomes like education, income or certain health behaviors.”
That means that scientists can use this type of data to get a better understanding of how people who choose not to answer questionnaires might also share similar responses to questions about health or social behaviors. Geneticists can also use the results of this study to correct for bias in genetic studies of any behavioral, psychiatric or medical outcomes.
“We can’t parcel out the signal from the noise yet or causally tease apart the effects of environment from the effects of biology,” Wedow said. “We know the genetics correlate with certain outcomes, but we are not at a point where we can say any specific gene causes any one outcome. The effect of each individual gene is small. It’s only in large data sets that we start to get the statistical power to get meaningful, reproducible results. We are using these new exciting, emerging data and tools to revolutionize social science.”

"AnalySwift receives nearly $800,000 NASA contract to improve simulation of next-generation composites","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
NASA has awarded a $799,954 Phase II STTR contract to AnalySwift LLC, a Purdue University-affiliated commercial software provider. The company will develop DATC, or Design tool for Advanced Tailorable Composites, and launch it at the end of the two-year contract.
Allan Wood, AnalySwift president and CEO, said advancements in simulation capabilities have not always kept pace with those in manufacturing techniques. He said DATC will significantly improve NASA’s capabilities to design and analyze aerospace structures made from advanced tailorable composites.
“DATC will be used to design next-generation aerospace structures, such as hybrid/blended wing bodies, space launch vehicles, space habitats and payload attach fittings,” Wood said. “These structures made from advanced tailorable composites will be lightweight and have enhanced performance.”
Traditional composites consist of straight fibers in a matrix, which make predicting their properties more straightforward, Wood said. Advanced tailorable composites are not limited to straight fibers.
“These materials include tow-steered composites, in which fibers are steered along curvilinear paths instead of traditional straight paths, and variable thickness composites in which layers, often called plies, vary in thickness or drop off altogether. The materials can be reinforced with either continuous or short fibers,” Wood said.
“This customization can facilitate drastic reductions in structural weights and/or improvements in the load-bearing capacity, though the increased complexity renders it much more difficult to accurately predict their properties.”
AnalySwift will integrate several tools to create DATC.
“DATC will be based on mechanics of structure genome, or MSG, and its companion code SwiftComp, which was developed at Purdue University,” Wood said. “It also will include third-party structural solver tools, a general-purpose optimizer and a machine learning package. These tools will be integrated into a unified and intuitive design framework.”
Wood said without a simulation tool for advanced tailorable composites, engineers must rely only on costly and time-consuming physical experiments instead of supplementing them with virtual testing and design.
“This often leads components to be overbuilt and over budget,” Wood said.
Wenbin Yu, a professor in Purdue’s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, is the principal investigator on the development of DATC. Su Tian of AnalySwift and professor Xin Liu of the University of Texas at Arlington are co-investigators.
“This project will use the mechanics of structure genome and the companion code SwiftComp, recently developed at Purdue, to provide efficient yet accurate solutions for advanced tailorable composites,” Yu said.
Wood said AnalySwift expects to complete DATC when the Phase II project ends in December 2024.
“We plan to release DATC to NASA engineers and others interested in this product,” Wood said. “Engineers can use DATC to create innovative, lightweight solutions for systems critical for national security, the environment, transportation, the economy and more. Besides NASA, other related government agencies and industries will be benefit from using DATC to design better engineering systems with reduced experiments and further adjustments, which lowers engineering time and cost.”
In 2022 AnalySwift received two Phase I STTR contracts from NASA, a one-year contract for $120,000 and a 13-month contract for $156,000. The company licenses Purdue University intellectual property through the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization. This work was also supported by Elevate Ventures and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation.

Expert: How wildfires contaminate drinking water,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
As wildfire season continues, a Purdue University professor is sharing his expertise on how fire damage can impact drinking water.
Andrew Whelton, a Purdue professor of civil engineering and environmental and ecological engineering, has traveled numerous times to the sites of wildfires, where he and his students collect water samples to help guide a community on the best way to restore its water systems.
This research is expected to lead to the first national recommendations on the roles and responsibilities of utilities and federal and state agencies for addressing drinking water contamination caused by wildfires. Later this year, the recommendations will be published as a “concept of operations plan” written by Whelton and funded by the Water Research Foundation.
Whelton also provides assistance from afar to communities experiencing post-wildfire drinking water contamination and regularly speaks with disaster response groups across the world to increase awareness of the problem.
This spring, Whelton traveled to Europe, where he met with public health groups and researchers who were seeking to better understand drinking water contamination after witnessing Europe’s second worst wildfire season last year.
Whelton and his students have published several milestone papers since testing water samples from the sites of the most destructive wildfires in California and Colorado over the past few years. These studies provided some of the earliest evidence suggesting that chemicals called volatile organic compounds enter drinking water when wildfires degrade plastic pipes. Whelton’s research group also was the first to publish on how wildfires contaminate private drinking water wells, a study his team conducted based on samples from Colorado’s 2021 Marshall Fire.
The team recently published a paper with findings on how benzene, a chemical leached from heat-degraded pipes, contaminates water softeners. Other upcoming papers look at how wildfire contamination affects plastics used for soda fountains and appliances.

Purdue-launched solid rocket motor-maker Adranos flies off with Anduril,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Adranos Inc., a Purdue-originated company that grew from a doctoral project into an impactful company, has been acquired by a major Costa Mesa, California-based defense products company, Anduril Industries.
Terms of the deal were settled, and the acquisition was announced on Sunday (June 25) in The Wall Street Journal that Anduril Industries is to purchase Adranos, manufacturer of solid rocket motors and maker of ALITEC, a high-performance solid rocket fuel that gives greater payload capacity, range and speed to launch systems.
“The success of Adranos is the latest manifestation of Purdue’s heritage of flying with innovation and signifies three growing strengths at our university in recent years: startup creation by Boilermakers, national security and defense research for America, and economic development in Discovery Park District,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “Many future successes will be delivered in these directions through Purdue Innovates, Purdue Applied Research Institute and the Hard Tech Corridor.”
Brielle Terry invented ALITEC in 2015 while she was a postdoctoral student in Purdue’s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics and continued his work at Purdue’s School of Mechanical Engineering. Both schools are consistently ranked in the top 10 by U.S. News & World Report. With help from Chris Stoker, an MBA graduate and Doctor of Law from Indiana University, Terry created business plans for ALITEC, a more powerful and more efficient solid rocket fuel that is also less damaging to the environment. Stoker and Terry went on to co-found Adranos, where Stoker is CEO and Terry is chief technology officer.
After the company was founded, Adranos participated in Purdue Innovates’ accelerator program in the Startup Foundry, which gave the company access to mentors, investors and other valuable resources. Adranos also leveraged connections with the Foundry’s alumni network and received guidance from Purdue alumni who had expertise in defense and space industry. Purdue’s growing reputation as a leader in entrepreneurship played a pivotal role in establishing Adranos’ credibility, helping attract investors, partners and talent.
Purdue University provides an intentional environment for startups to thrive. The resources available through Purdue Innovates, connections to an abundant innovation ecosystem and access to Purdue-affiliated facilities have played a pivotal role in the success and rapid scaling of Adranos, solidifying the university’s reputation as a driving force behind transformative startups.
“As Purdue rose to world leadership in patents and startups, it was inevitable that great successes like Adranos would follow” said Mitch Daniels, board chair of Purdue Research Foundation and former Purdue University President. “We’re enormously proud not only from a business standpoint but also of the contribution this Purdue innovation will make to the security of our nation.
“We created the environment for Purdue startups to thrive and succeed. Adranos is a homegrown Boilermaker success story, joining a growing list of acquisitions like Dr. Phil Low’s startup, Endocyte, who inked a $2.1 billion acquisition deal. We anticipate there will be many other companies to follow in their footsteps.”
Adranos broke ground on a rocket fuel production facility in 2020 at Purdue Research Park. The company received financial support from the Purdue Research Foundation and the Indiana Economic Development Corp. to construct the facility, which opened in West Lafayette in September 2022. Adranos also has a solid rocket motor production facility in Mississippi and an engineering office in Alabama.
“Purdue University and the Purdue Research Foundation played critical roles in the success of Adranos. While I was a postdoc at Purdue, I was given the resources and opportunities to convert a conceptual innovation into reality” said Terry, Adranos CTO.
“Additionally, thanks to the Purdue Research Foundation, Adranos was able to transform its lab-scale technical innovation into a state-of-the-art rocket fuel production facility. We have been able to move so fast because of Purdue’s amazing entrepreneurial resources, specifically the Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship and technical leadership.”
Terry used the commercialization and innovation resources now aggregated under Purdue Innovates, a program that houses the Office of Technology Commercialization, which seeks to build up products and ideas and get them out of the lab and into society. Purdue University has consistently ranked among the top 10 most innovative universities in the U.S. for five consecutive years and holds the impressive position of being the fifth-ranked university in the world for utility patents.
Adranos “is an excellent example of Purdue intellectual property making its way out of the lab, into a startup, and making a real-world impact” in this program, said Brooke Beier, senior vice president of Purdue Innovates. “This demonstrates the entrepreneurial nature of our Boilermaker students. A PhD student participated in components of what now make up Purdue Innovates, located their company in Purdue Research Park and now has a successful exit. From start to finish, Adranos demonstrates the success of the services and principles that constitute the Purdue Research Foundation.
“We created the startup supportive environment and Adranos capitalized on the offerings and put in a tremendous amount of work. As we work to build a strong and unique deal flow with our Purdue Angel Network, we are seeking wins where the startup exits by being acquired or through an IPO. Adranos’ acquisition exit is a clear win for the Purdue Innovates team.”","[{'summary_text': 'ALITEC is a solid rocket fuel that gives greater payload capacity, range and speed to launch systems . adranos broke ground on a rocket fuel production facility in 2020 at Purdue Research Park .'}]"

It’s never too late to come back. ‘Purdue Global was built for working adults like us.’,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
One of the most striking things about married couple Donna Cummings-Ripp (MS management and leadership – information technology ’23, Purdue Global) and Joe Ripp (master’s in business administration ’23, Purdue Global) is how proud they are of each another.
As they anticipated walking the stage together to receive their Purdue Global degrees, they recalled what it was like pursuing degrees at the same time while also juggling full-time jobs and multiple side gigs, and how the life ahead of them made it all worth it.
While many people want a degree to change their path, they wanted degrees to go further on theirs. Bettering their lives and others’ was always at the center. That’s because, although the two come from surprisingly different backgrounds, they both grew up in families that valued community and the importance of education, hard work, honor and stability.
“My parents valued education above anything else. They were all about me going to school, getting good grades and enjoying extracurricular activities,” Donna says.
She carried that inspiration all through her schooling, into her marriage, and it even sparked her interest in seeking an online master’s degree suited for working adults – 20 years after earning her bachelor’s.
“It’s one reason why we both decided to go back to school,” she says. “We had good jobs; there was nothing wrong there. But being exposed to new things and having that drive to advance in our current careers with our current companies meant a lot to us.”

Are cars lasting longer than they used to? – new video uploaded to AP Video Hub,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A video featuring Greg Shaver, Purdue University professor of mechanical engineering and director of the Ray W. Herrick Laboratories, has been uploaded to the AP Video Hub. In the video, he explains why people are holding on to their cars longer than they did in the past. This video can be found at https://apvideohub.ap.org/detail/Arecarslastinglongerthantheyusedto/a02fbd29e65645f0b46e3acb76b1df41.

AP members may use the video or pull quotes for print articles, broadcasts or podcasts.
Storyline:
Shaver says that cars are more durable and perform better than they did 20 years ago. At the same time, new cars cost around 25 percent more and used cars cost 40 percent more than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic. Shaver believes these factors together have led drivers to hold on to their cars longer. He says conventional vehicles can last up to 13 years if cared for properly. Shaver expects electric cars will not last as long as other vehicles due to wear and tear on the battery. With ongoing challenges in the supply chain and labor markets, he believes that car prices will continue to increase.","[{'summary_text': 'a video featuring purdue professor of mechanical engineering has been uploaded to the AP Video Hub . in the video, he explains why people are holding on to their cars longer than they did in the past .'}]"
"Purdue Global’s organizational management program equips employees for new leadership, managerial roles","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Jeffery Bonnewell had worked supervisory and management roles within manufacturing since 2017. Good jobs, indeed. Yet he’d soon realize he had hit a career plateau. He wanted more and knew he had it in him.
That’s when he turned to Purdue Global, Purdue’s online university for working adults, and specifically to its organizational management program. It provided just the boost he desired.
As Bonnewell was earning his Bachelor of Science in organizational management, he landed a new position as a manufacturing quality engineer at Dorel Juvenile Group, a leading car seat manufacturer in Indiana.
The organizational management program is designed to help workers who have skills transferable to other jobs or positions, including operations, management, franchising, accounting and inventory management. It helped get Bonnewell where he wanted to go.
“I was taking things I was learning through the courses, texts and my professors, and I was using that in my day-to-day role with my company,” Bonnewell said. “I believe those skills helped me to get where I am now.”
Bonnewell, of Greensburg, Indiana, believes the degree program was a “perfect fit” for him, as he has a passion for people, mentoring and coaching.
He is not alone. Others have seen the payoff from the program as well, such as recent graduate Kathy Whelan of Perry Hall, Maryland.
Whelan, who serves as a medical student coordinator at MedStar Health, a large health care provider in Maryland and the Washington, D.C., region, wanted to finish her degree.
A Purdue Global advisor talked to her about her goals, what she wanted to do as she finished up her degree program and what she needed to complete the program.
Many of her previous credits transferred over to Purdue Global, and Whelan was able to complete the program in 15 months. She participated in the May 2023 commencement and also has placed her diploma on display at her office.
“This may help me advance into better positions, such as management,” Whelan said. “I had really great professors. They were able to help me apply the concepts to the real world.” “Their life experiences and the fact they work in the professional field really helps enhance the education for the student.”
The organizational management degree program through the Purdue Global School of Business and Information Technology launched following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as many sectors of the economy suffered huge job losses. More than 400 students have enrolled in the program, with more than 60 students graduating since its inception.
Purdue Global administrators and faculty members, including Jennifer Lasater, vice president of student and career advancement, looked for ways to create a program that could help workers who lost their jobs and were looking for retraining or a new career path.
“There are people with top skills such as management, leadership, operations, sales, communication, customer service and scheduling who have spent a good amount of time in their jobs but without a lot of upward mobility,” Lasater said.
The job market in many categories is looking for general management roles. Employers are traditionally looking for skilled workers with previous experience, and many of them require a bachelor’s degree. While some workers can’t leave their current job, they could pursue additional education that would help them upskill.
“We’ve seen outcomes in many different environments and industries. This degree is what Purdue Global is all about: recognizing the skills and experience that our adult learners possess, educating them on the skills they need, and helping them to advance in their careers,” Lasater said.

"Fathers push the limits searching for balance, family and education","summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
When Jeffery Bonnewell of Greensburg, Indiana, crossed the stage to receive his degree from Purdue Global on May 6, he knew his parents; wife, Courtney; and son, Mason, were in the crowd cheering him on.
The accomplishment of the day isn’t just that Bonnewell graduated and a family gathering happened. The graduation and celebration were years in the making.
After high school, Bonnewell had gone directly into the workforce. He has worked in manufacturing since 2017. Yet he knew that to get a promotion, he would need a bachelor’s degree.
“Being a full-time student, a full-time father and a full-time employee are a lot of full-time jobs to juggle all at once,” Bonnewell said. “The responsibilities were on me.”
He attended community college while working but dropped out to focus on supporting his family. If he could go back in time, he would tell himself to go to school and complete the degree.
“This is my comeback,” Bonnewell said, surrounded by other graduates and their families following commencement. “My son has already said he wants to go to Purdue when he gets older.”
Mason knew his dad was working toward his degree, as the elder Bonnewell would let him listen and watch the lectures. Bonnewell credits good time management, organizational skills and family support as keys to juggling all the responsibilities, especially as he works on earning his master’s degree.
“I would tell him, ‘Daddy’s in class right now. I’ll play with you as soon as I’m done.’ Or, ‘Daddy’s working on homework. I’ll play with you as soon as I’m done,’” he said. “I made sure to follow through on those promises. Mason understands this is a big achievement for me and our family.”
Like Bonnewell, Brock Turner understands the importance of following through on promises to children.
Turner, a health and human sciences educator for Purdue Extension — Tippecanoe County from Lafayette, Indiana, completed his three Purdue Global degrees while raising his two boys, Bryce, 7, and Leo, 4.
“Between work, being a dad and classwork — you focus spending time more on those areas than in the other areas of life,” said Turner, who has a Bachelor of Science degree in health and wellness (2019), a Master of Science in health education (’21), and a Master of Public Health (’21). “We were doing the things we needed to do to accomplish what we had set out to do.”
A key to his success was establishing new routines as a parent and as a returning student.
“There were times I had to type up things that were due at midnight. Sometimes they just wanted to sit and listen to the lecture to be next to Dad,” Turner said of his children. “I had to stop writing a paper to read a bedtime story, make sure I would set an alarm to roll out of bed and not fall asleep with them, and get back to work.”
Going back to school with young children was his comeback. He had tried different programs, but once he found Purdue Global, he discovered it had many positives, some of which have opened doors — including helping him land his new role at Purdue Extension and leadership positions on university committees.
Bryce and Leo sat with him as they watched the virtual graduation ceremony for his master’s in health education. They were excited when they saw his face on the screen.
“A chance to be a good role model for them was the motivation I needed,” Turner said. “I hope I have inspired them.”
He has used his education and schoolwork to help Bryce.
“I’ve told him it’s about dedicating time. Sometimes it is hard, and it’s OK to have a setback. You just have to work through it,” Turner said. “If I can do it, you can do it.”
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults. Of the nearly 35,000 students, 51% have a child or other dependents.
Danielle Hadeed de Silva, a psychologist and faculty member in Purdue Global’s College of Social and Behavioral Sciences who lives in South Florida, says fathers and father figures face three major challenges today: time management, finding work-life-school balance and addressing mental health issues.
“It is important for dads to set boundaries with their family. And also, to schedule time with them, to do family things,” Hadeed de Silva said. “During that time, dads need to be as fully present as possible, meaning they should put their smartphones away and engage with their family.”
Another aspect of self-care: seeking mental health services when needed, she added.
“There is such a stigma associated with seeking help. This idea of toxic masculinity still lingers within our society, so men feel like they cannot seek out services, which is to their detriment. There are so many services available out there, and nowadays, through telehealth, you don’t even need to leave your home in order to receive counseling. Your privacy is even more protected,” she said.
Pursuing academic goals is a tremendous way to tell children that hard work can lead to achieved goals and dreams.
“They are modeling what they want for their own children to set goals for themselves, to strive to achieve those goals, even when it’s hard, because it is very challenging to try to balance everything,” Hadeed de Silva said. “If their kids see their fathers working hard and achieving those goals, the kids believe that they can do it as well.”
If a father figure feels like he is slipping in an area such as family, work or school, she said, it is OK to talk with others and stop to reset.
“It’s important for us to not only celebrate our fathers, our grandfathers, our uncles … but also to think about how the role of fatherhood plays into some of the stress that they are facing while they try to balance work, family life and school,” Hadeed de Silva said.

Purdue University in Indianapolis: Launching Purdue’s first comprehensive urban campus and forming America’s Hard Tech Corridor,"summarize:Info for journalists
INDIANAPOLIS —
On June 14, 2023, Purdue University trustees and Indiana University trustees simultaneously approved the agreements that will effectively dissolve IUPUI on June 30, 2024, completing a process that started in August 2022. Now, two outstanding universities with complementary strengths will arise in Indianapolis, making this a momentous day for our state.
At the same time, Purdue’s Board of Trustees further established Purdue University in Indianapolis, with multiple locations throughout the city and degrees from Purdue University West Lafayette. In addition to continuing the PU part of IUPUI, Purdue will bring many more programs from possibly all colleges and departments in West Lafayette to Indianapolis.
Purdue will have the physical resources, state appropriations and freedom to independently operate its urban campus. This will allow Purdue to expand the academic and research excellence that the university is known for to Indiana’s capital city, while investing in and partnering with Indianapolis to significantly grow the tech-driven economy in central Indiana.
“Today’s announcement launches transformative growth for our state’s land-grant university, and Boilermakers are excited to serve the people, businesses and communities of Indianapolis. We thank all of our partners: those at Indiana University; the government, civic and business leaders who have been with us throughout this process; and the many colleagues, alumni and neighbors who provided insightful input. We thank our Indiana General Assembly for their support,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “An urban setting offers unique programs in academics, research and partnership for students and faculty, and Indianapolis has its many special strengths. Starting today, new opportunities for Purdue University in Indianapolis are limitless.”
The new Purdue University in Indianapolis will assume responsibility for the existing engineering, computer science and technology programs at IUPUI and confer Purdue West Lafayette degrees. Purdue will also be able to introduce and grow enrollments in other colleges and departments in Indianapolis, e.g., Daniels School of Business, Pharmacy, Health and Human Sciences, Science, Agriculture and more.
Purdue anticipates substantially increasing today’s Indianapolis enrollment with plans for a 28-acre campus footprint stretching beyond the existing IUPUI engineering and technology buildings, which Purdue students will continue to use. Purdue received $60 million from the Indiana General Assembly to fund the first academic and student success building on the newly available land, and working groups are targeting additional building projects, including a possible new residence hall. Purdue University in Indianapolis students and faculty will continue to have access to all campus and academic facilities for the foreseeable future. Purdue is also exploring additional locations throughout the city of Indianapolis for expansion of academic and research programs.
To contribute to the civic life of the city and community, and recognizing the historical significance of the area surrounding Indiana Avenue, Purdue has pledged support to the Indiana Avenue Certified Strategic Plan, which will inform the development of the surrounding neighborhoods, including the Purdue University in Indianapolis campus. Purdue University is also exploring additional physical facilities throughout Indianapolis.
Since Purdue University in Indianapolis is not a regional university, there is no chancellor. Professor David Umulis will serve as the chief academic officer for Purdue University in Indianapolis in his current role as senior vice provost, reporting to Provost Patrick Wolfe of Purdue University. Dan Hasler, who formerly served as secretary of commerce for the state of Indiana, will serve as chief operating officer for Purdue University in Indianapolis, reporting to Chiang.
The new Purdue University in Indianapolis will also serve as one bookend for a 65-mile-long Hard Tech Corridor in Indiana, stretching from downtown Indianapolis, through the LEAP Innovation District in Lebanon with new sites from companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, all the way to Discovery Park District in West Lafayette.
Purdue will invest in making the Hard Tech Corridor the most consequential engine of economic growth and brain gain in the Midwest as it continues to generate workforce, jobs and innovation together with partners.
The dramatically growing needs of Indiana have been calling for the correspondingly bold move toward the creation of Purdue University in Indianapolis to provide the world-class higher education and research capabilities the local economy needs. Central Indiana business and community leaders have expressed concern about shortages of talent well trained in the engineering, sciences, technological and health care disciplines, and a related gap in local capacity for high-end research. Purdue University has achieved excellence at scale among the very top universities in the country, ranking among the top four U.S. universities in agriculture, graduate engineering and utility patents and, across all leading American universities, as No. 1 in undergraduate STEM enrollment. Now, with a plan to ambitiously increase student enrollment at the Indianapolis campus, Purdue University in Indianapolis will create new knowledge and establish a strong pipeline of Boilermaker talent to the capital city.
After the IUPUI transition is completed, Purdue University will have continued collaboration with Indiana University, where each university’s strengths will enhance funding opportunities for joint research initiatives in Indianapolis, including creation of a joint institute for engineering in medicine between the Purdue University Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering and the Indiana University School of Medicine. This new institute will develop new life-enhancing therapies and technologies while simultaneously creating a highly sought-after pool of professionals whose unique research and training will create startups and attract new companies to the Indianapolis and central Indiana region.
The new Purdue University in Indianapolis dramatically increases the opportunities for faculty, staff and students in Indianapolis that can only come by joining and fully integrating with a top 10 public university and one of the world’s most innovative institutions.
Taking advantage of the excellence at scale established over the past 150-plus years, there are new opportunities for Purdue University in Indianapolis students and staff to grow their professional networks; access the full breadth of courses; leverage world-class facilities in Purdue’s Discovery Park District, including the Birck Nanotechnology Center; utilize the technology and commercialization pipeline facilitated by the Purdue Research Foundation; participate in statewide cooperative extension to see discoveries making an impact throughout the state; and access resources for career advancement.
Faculty, staff and students will also be able to take full advantage of new programs developed in Indianapolis integrated with departments pursuing advancements in cybersecurity, autonomy, advanced manufacturing, microelectronics, AI, business analytics, biomedical engineering, sports technology, hospitality and tourism management, pharmaceutical discovery and manufacturing, to list a few. Purdue’s strengths lie in its mission and its people – and the combined physical locations create the environment to solve the problems of tomorrow as one university with one mission leading the charge together.
Putting the Old Gold and Black and Indianapolis together, Purdue University in Indianapolis will create unique opportunities for current West Lafayette students and faculty, allowing them to pursue research, internship or entrepreneurial opportunities with Indianapolis companies or opt to take entire semesters on the new urban campus. There are also compelling possibilities for faculty in West Lafayette, including tighter faculty-industry collaborations, improved access to the Indianapolis entrepreneurial ecosystem, better opportunities to attract faculty who prefer an urban lifestyle, and advantages for dual-career hires.
More information can be found at the Purdue University in Indianapolis website, including a fact sheet and an evolving FAQ. Suggestions for Purdue University in Indianapolis can be emailed to Purdueindy@purdue.edu.

Indiana University and Purdue University sign historic agreement,"summarize:INDIANAPOLIS —
Indiana’s two world-class public research universities, Indiana University and Purdue University, are transforming their 53-year-old collaborative IUPUI vision with the creation of separate and independent urban campuses in the capital city: Indiana University Indianapolis and Purdue University in Indianapolis.
The Boards of Trustees from both Indiana University and Purdue University approved a definitive agreement on Wednesday afternoon to formalize the separation of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. The agreement formalizes the creation of Indiana University Indianapolis, the new name for IU’s existing campus in Indianapolis, and Purdue University in Indianapolis, the first comprehensive urban campus of Purdue University. IU, the state’s largest research university, comprises a portfolio that includes seven campuses and two regional education centers statewide. Purdue’s flagship West Lafayette campus will be expanded to Purdue University in Indianapolis. Each university is slated to begin its separate Indianapolis operations in fall 2024.
The creation of independent campuses will enable the two higher education powerhouses to build upon their incredible legacies of excellence and impact to meet the needs of Indiana and its capital city for decades to come. Leveraging the strength of globally respected reputations independently, IU, Purdue, and the state of Indiana will each benefit from recently announced plans by each institution to expand extensive academic and research portfolios, increase talent attraction and retention programs, and invest millions of dollars in both individual and collaborative efforts.
“IU’s goal is nothing short of building one of the nation’s preeminent urban research universities, one defined by students transformed, discoveries made and communities strengthened,” IU President Pamela Whitten said. “Through this agreement we will unlock the remarkable potential of both institutions to meet the needs of our city and state. I am grateful for our many partners at Purdue University, and to the extensive state and community leadership, that have made today’s progress possible.”
“Today’s announcement launches transformative growth for our state’s land-grant university, and Boilermakers are excited to serve the people, businesses and communities of Indianapolis,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “Purdue will invest in, partner with, and together grow the tech-driven economy in central Indiana. We thank all of our partners at Indiana University and the many government, civic and business leaders who have been with us throughout this process. New opportunities for Purdue University in Indianapolis are limitless.”
With today’s action by the Indiana University and Purdue University Boards of Trustees, all academic programs at IUPUI will transition to become part of IU Indianapolis in July 2024, with the exception of the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology and Computer Science within School of Science, which will become part of Purdue University in Indianapolis.
Thanks to dedicated appropriations from the Indiana General Assembly, IU will significantly expand and renovate research and laboratory facilities to support growing numbers of STEM faculty, including through the School of Science. To meet crucial talent and research needs, IU is also expanding the nation’s first school of informatics – the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering – in Indianapolis. IU Indianapolis will offer new programs, including in applied computer science, while pursuing significantly expanded student enrollment at the Luddy School. These efforts will be central to IU’s recently announced SciTech Corridor, to be located at Michigan and West streets.
IU Indianapolis will also enhance the integration of its science programs with the IU School of Medicine and other allied health science schools, expanding the number of students who will be prepared for health science-based careers, improving the pipeline of doctors and nurses and keeping more graduates in the state.
In addition, IU will have responsibility for providing certain administrative services for both universities and for the intercollegiate athletic program. IU will continue to provide transformative educational experiences for the more than 20,000 students in other IU programs, such as business, law, nursing, social work and a wide range of other academic disciplines.
IU officials also noted the university’s partnership with the Madam Walker Legacy Center as a reflection of its commitment to embracing and engaging with a diverse array of community leaders, particularly in the neighborhood immediately adjacent to the current IUPUI campus. Both IU and Purdue also emphasized the importance of honoring the cultural and historic significance of Indiana Avenue, while ensuring shared progress that fosters thriving, culturally significant communities alongside two nationally regarded institutions of higher education.
The Purdue Board of Trustees voted to establish Purdue University in Indianapolis, Purdue’s first comprehensive urban campus, effective July 1, 2024. Purdue University in Indianapolis will assume responsibility for the existing engineering, computer science and technology programs at IUPUI and confer Purdue West Lafayette degrees. Purdue will also introduce programs from other colleges and departments in West Lafayette to Indianapolis, such as the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, and create exciting opportunities for current West Lafayette faculty and students in Indianapolis to pursue research, internship or entrepreneurial opportunities with Indianapolis companies.
Purdue University in Indianapolis will create new knowledge and establish a strong pipeline of Boilermaker talent to the capital city, including some of the more than 30,000 STEM students currently enrolled in West Lafayette. Purdue University in Indianapolis will help connect talents and industry, maximize Indy’s unique strength in sports and biomedical technology, and fuel transformative job and economic growth in the region and state.
Thanks to the state legislature’s support, Purdue anticipates substantially growing today’s Indianapolis enrollment; along with plans for a 28-acre campus footprint beyond the existing IUPUI Engineering & Technology buildings is the exploration of additional facilities throughout the city of Indianapolis. Understanding the historical significance of the area surrounding Indiana Avenue, Purdue will be an active participant in the “reimagining Indiana Avenue discussions” which will inform the development of the surrounding neighborhoods.
The new Purdue University in Indianapolis will also serve as one bookend for a 65-mile-long Hard Tech Corridor in Indiana, stretching from downtown Indianapolis, through the LEAP Innovation District in Lebanon with new sites from companies such as Eli Lilly, all the way to Discovery Park District in West Lafayette.
Additionally, the agreement between the two universities allows both institutions to expand their academic and research offerings at their respective operations in Fort Wayne.
IUPUI had a proud, 53-year record of accomplishment, evolving from a local commuter school to the third-largest undergraduate campus and one of the biggest research campuses in Indiana. Its 200,000-plus living alumni contribute mightily to the state’s economic growth.
Amid this transition to separate IU Indianapolis and Purdue University in Indianapolis campuses, key elements of what made IUPUI successful will remain:
Proximity to world-class employers.
Proximity to state government, within walking distance of campus.
Engagement with the community, extending even to faculty, a cutting-edge attribute only now being emulated by others.
The collaborative spirit in Indianapolis between Purdue and IU.
Pride in what has been accomplished over 53 years, gratitude to the faculty and staff who made it possible, and a loyal alumni base.
A commitment from both Purdue and IU to continue executive and mid-career education in Indianapolis.
The dramatically growing needs of our state call for a correspondingly bold move to provide the world-class higher education and research capabilities our economy needs. Central Indiana business and community leaders have expressed concern about shortages of talent well-trained in the engineering, sciences, technological and health care disciplines, and a related gap in local capacity for high-end research.
The separation of IU and Purdue into individual Indianapolis campuses will increase the number of job-ready graduates in an innovation-led economy, fuel economic growth in the region and the state, and enhance service to the Indianapolis community and beyond. It also provides a platform for collaboration in which each university’s strengths will enhance funding opportunities for joint research initiatives.

Cloud computing and blue-sky thinking: An atmospheric scientist illuminates the science of clouds in Earth’s sky and beyond,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Alexandria Johnson does hard science on the most nebulous of subjects: clouds. As an atmospheric scientist and assistant professor of practice in Purdue University’s College of Science, she studies clouds wherever they are: in her lab, on Earth, throughout the solar system and into the galaxy.
“The coolest thing about my research is that I can see clouds every day,” Johnson said. “I can look up into our own atmosphere and watch them change and evolve. Then I can take that knowledge and apply it to other planetary bodies, both within and outside our solar system.”
The science of clouds covers a lot of ground. Her research shines light into topics ranging from the rainfall and microplastic precipitation in Indiana to the climates of moons and planets far outside the realm of human experience.
Studying clouds in their natural environments can be complex and subject to the variations of climate, weather and observation devices. Johnson’s solution is to create her own homegrown clouds to study in her lab in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. She strips the systems down to their basics to get a clear understanding on how the particles that make up clouds form, develop and interact with their environment. Nothing in her lab actually looks like a cloud; there are no mists swirling picturesquely in glass bottles. It’s mostly lasers and big black boxes. But the behavior of these lab-based cloud particles mimics the behavior of cloud particles in massive sky-sweeping clouds, only in miniature.
“Of course, we don’t grow them at quite the same scale you see in an atmosphere,” Johnson said. “Instead, we can take one particle that is representative of a cloud, pump in different gases, and change the temperature and pressure of the system. We then watch as that particle grows, shrinks or changes phase with time, which are processes that happen in clouds everywhere.”
Clouds on Earth don’t often form without the aid of a nuclei, or a particle, and in some cases what would be considered a nuclei on Earth may be an exotic cloud elsewhere. The particles in Johnson’s lab, like all particles, have a charge. Johnson and her team use an electric field to levitate and contain the individual particles so that they can’t move around. These particles are then stable for extended periods of time, which enables long-term research experiments, where the pressure, temperature, electric field and laser illumination may be tweaked, and observations recorded. Other methods build upon these to allow the team to look at groups of particles and observe how they scatter and polarize light.
Using methods like these, Johnson can study how clouds form and what different cloud particle shapes and compositions can reveal, and she is able to understand the conditions that lead to different cloud types and behaviors. Like aeronautical engineers using a wind tunnel to observe how currents move around structures, Johnson uses these particles to understand the microphysics that underpin vast and complex systems.
Many scientists – climatologists, meteorologists and planetary scientists, to name a few – study clouds as part of their broader research. But Johnson is one of the few who studies the particular physics of clouds in the laboratory.
“There are not many of us who dig into the microphysics of how clouds form,” Johnson said. “Anyone who studies the atmosphere has a general sense of knowledge about clouds. But none of those systems work without the physics. We have to understand the microphysics to truly grasp the complexities and implications.”
It’s a long-running joke that the nights of notable astronomical events on Earth seem to be almost supernaturally disposed to be cloudy. That is true of other planets, too.
Using enormous, advanced, vastly powerful telescopes, astronomers can peer through miles and light-years of space just to find clouds blocking their view of the planet itself. Rather than the planet’s surface, they can only perceive the opaque atmosphere that enswathes it.
Every planetary body in the solar system that has a dense atmosphere, and many outside of it, has clouds in that atmosphere. Even bodies with thin, wispy or intermittent atmospheres – like Pluto – have particulates hanging in the atmosphere that, while not true clouds, are a haze of particles and share many of clouds’ properties.
“Clouds are a ubiquitous feature of planetary atmospheres,” Johnson said. “This is something we’ve seen from our own solar system, and when we look at exoplanet atmospheres, it’s no surprise that we find clouds there too. Unfortunately, they tend to block our view of the atmosphere that is below.”
Scientists have been able to send probes and rovers to close planetary neighbors, including Venus and Mars. But for bodies that are farther away, including exoplanets – planets in other star systems entirely – scientists must come up with clever ways to conduct science.
“The astronomers find the clouds to be an annoyance. They get in the way of the data they want, whether that’s learning about the surface of the planet or its atmospheric composition,” Johnson said. “We see it a little differently. Yes, they’re there. We can’t get rid of them. So let’s use our understanding of clouds on Earth and planetary atmospheres of our solar system to learn about these things that we can’t observe in exoplanets.”
Most of the planets Johnson studies are “cool” planets. While Earth seems balmy (with planetary temperature averages around 60 degrees Fahrenheit), it is actually chilly by planetary standards, when contrasted to large, gas giants orbiting close to their stars like hot Jupiters.
Johnson and her team accumulate information about planetary bodies in Earth’s solar system or exoplanets. Astronomers can collect spectrographic data to analyze the chemical compounds that make up the atmosphere and use mathematical models, observations and gravitation studies to determine a planet’s mass, speed and orbit. Combining that information with insights from her laboratory studies, Johnson can help astronomers determine what a planet’s atmosphere might be like and extrapolate its chance for hosting life.
“Our big questions are when, where and why do clouds form in these atmospheres?” Johnson said. “If we want to understand these enshrouded exoplanets, we need to understand the clouds. That understanding gives us insights into the atmospheric chemistry at work, atmospheric circulation and the climate. In a way we ground-truth astronomical observations.”
Johnson is also looking up at the clouds from below, a little closer to home. In a current study, she is examining the role microplastics play in cloud formation. Microplastics pollution, which has been found just about everywhere, including large bodies of water like the Great Lakes, may form a part of clouds or be scavenged by precipitation, then shower the landscape in rainstorms and snowfall. Those microplastics have dire implications for ecosystem health, human health and agriculture.
Understanding how they become attached to clouds, move through weather systems and impact the landscape when deposited can help Johnson and her team protect life on Earth, just as they explore the possibility of livable conditions on other planets.
“It’s the same physics,” Johnson said. “It’s the same processes, all throughout the universe, and it brings me a huge amount of wonder and joy. As an undergraduate physics major, I chose a senior research project studying how water droplets froze under varying conditions. I literally watched a droplet freeze hundreds of times to study the process and was entranced. I said, ‘This is what I want to do with my life. This is amazing. I want to study clouds.’”

‘Purdue Global moved me forward’,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
In their early 20s, Lauren Castrinos Bradford (MS psychology ’20, Purdue Global) and her husband, Keegan, were dreaming about a life together. Their vision was so clear, they felt like they could touch it – everything from the two children they wanted to have, to the house and the yard, all the way down to the Chevy Tahoe in the driveway of their Anderson, South Carolina, home.
Now they can touch it, thanks to her degree from Purdue Global. The dreams they had are real, physical parts of their life. But the way everything came together was nothing like what they had pictured. It was harder. Scarier. Slower. And filled with more love and triumph than they could have ever imagined.
As the May 2023 commencement speaker, Bradford talked about raising her family, her Purdue Global experience, and how she earned her board certified behavior analyst credential and is helping families through her work at Total Care ABA. Her commencement speech and additional videos are available online.

Beyond on and off: Purdue engineers create continuously tunable thermal regulators for batteries and electronic devices,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Battery safety and performance in electronic devices and systems like battery thermal management, space conditioning, vehicle thermal comfort and thermal energy storage can improve thanks to a continuously tunable thermal regulator created at Purdue University’s College of Engineering.
Xiulin Ruan and Amy Marconnet have invented patent-pending, solid-state, continuously tunable thermal devices based on compressible graphene foam composites. The devices can dissipate heat, insulate against cold and function across a wide range of temperatures. Ruan is a professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering. Marconnet is an associate professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering and a Perry Academic Excellence Scholar; she also has a courtesy appointment in the School of Materials Engineering.
“As batteries and electronic devices get more powerful, managing heat becomes a more crucial issue,” Ruan said. “We all know humans have a narrow range of temperature to live comfortably, and that is why we wear shirts in the summer to keep cool and coats in the winter to keep warm. Similarly, batteries and electronic devices have a narrow temperature range to function appropriately as well, and are even more ‘picky’ than humans.”
Marconnet said, “Batteries perform poorly if they are too hot. As they heat up, chemical reactions occur that cause them to heat up even faster. This unstable reaction progression is called ‘thermal runaway’ and can even lead to fires and explosions. On the other hand, if the temperatures are too low, batteries suffer internal damage. It leads to poor performance like shorter driving ranges for electric vehicles and less cellphone usage time.”
Conventional thermal switches, analogous to electrical switches that moderate current flow, tune a battery’s heat dissipation pathways only by changing the conduction between on and off states. Ruan said the Purdue-invented thermal regulators improve upon this technology by changing the thickness of the material inside the regulators, which helps batteries continually adjust to different climates and seasons.
“Unlike people being able to put on a coat when it is cold or a swimsuit when it is warm, a battery wears the same ‘clothes’ everywhere with conventional thermal management technology,” Marconnet said. “By using the thermal regulator to adjust the pathway between a battery and the environment, we can insulate the battery in cold conditions and make it very easy to dissipate heat in warm ones.”
The commercially available compressible graphene foam Ruan and Marconnet use is built from nanoscopic particles of carbon deposited in a specific pattern with small voids of air in between. When it is uncompressed, the foam acts as an insulator; air pockets keep the heat in place. When it is compressed, air escapes and heat is conducted throughout. The amount of heat transfer can be precisely dialed in depending on how much the foam is compressed.
Marconnet and Ruan measured the foam’s thermal conductance at Purdue’s Birck Nanotechnology Center. They sandwiched a 1.2-millimeter-thick sample of graphene foam in between a heater and heat sink, and placed the system under an infrared microscope to measure the temperature and heat flow. When they fully compressed the foam to a thickness of 0.2 millimeters, the thermal conductance went up by a factor of 8. They also conducted an experiment in a chamber at Purdue’s Flex Lab that can create specific environmental conditions and achieved similar results with ambient temperatures from zero degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit).
Ruan said the patent-pending regulators were initially created for electric vehicles’ batteries, but there are other applications.
“The same approach could be applied to sensors and detectors for scientific or industrial applications that need to be maintained at precise temperatures, as well as electronic devices across a range of applications,” Ruan said. “It may also help maintain appropriate temperature for space vehicles, which face harsh environments of extreme heat and cold.”
Ruan and Marconnet’s research was published in two peer-reviewed journals. The battery application research was published in the Aug. 13, 2021, issue of Nature Communications; the fundamental research was published in the Oct. 18, 2022, issue of ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.
Ruan and Marconnet disclosed the thermal regulators to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which applied for patent protection on the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in further developing the technology for the marketplace should contact Dhananjay Sewak, dsewak@prf.org, about 2020 RUAN-68896, “A Thermal Switch and Regulator Device Based on Graphene Foams.”
Marconnet and Ruan outlined the next steps to further develop the Purdue thermal regulators.
“We are looking to improve the range of thermal conductances achievable with the regulator. The best thermal regulators have a performance ratio of just 10. In contrast for electrical transport, resistances can change by many orders of magnitude. If we can make the good thermal conductance better and the bad thermal conductance worse, we can make a more effective regulator,” Marconnet said.
“Also, in the lab, the thermal regulator is manually actuated. We will work to automate this process, potentially taking feedback from temperature sensors to automatically adjust the parameters.”

"Purdue Global, Ivy Tech sign new Pathways Partnership agreement","summarize:Info for journalists
INDIANAPOLIS —
Leaders from Purdue Global and Ivy Tech Community College want to provide more access to higher education and degrees for the 350,000 Indiana workers who have some college credit but no degree and 2 million working-age Hoosiers overall who have no postsecondary credentials.
To help meet that challenge, leaders from the two schools on Monday (June 12) announced their new Pathways Partnership during an event at Ivy Tech’s main Indianapolis campus.
The agreement strengthens a longstanding and ever-growing partnership between the two schools, creates more opportunities, and provides scholarships and support for students to complete a higher education degree.
​​Under the Pathways Partnership, Purdue Global will accept unrestricted transfer and stackability of students’ Ivy Tech associate degrees and credits toward a Purdue Global bachelor’s degree. Purdue Global will work with those students to maximize their credit for prior learning, including competencies gained in the workplace and Ivy Tech prior learning credits. Students who have completed an Ivy Tech associate degree will be awarded an Ivy Tech Achievement Scholarship for most Purdue Global programs.
“Together, Ivy Tech and Purdue Global have created pathways to jobs and careers that are preparing the next-generation workforce for lifelong success, beginning with a world-class education,” said Ivy Tech President Sue Ellspermann. “Through this partnership, current Ivy Tech students have assurance that their associate degree will seamlessly transfer to a high-quality, affordable online bachelor’s degree at Purdue Global.”
Purdue Global Chancellor Frank Dooley said the partnership is a great fit for the two schools, especially given Purdue Global’s position as Purdue’s online university for working adults. Purdue Global is expanding the sense of community for those learning online with additional student life activities, community volunteering, student engagement platforms, and dedicated advising and academic support.
“Purdue Global continues the supportive pathway of the Ivy Tech student experience by providing a smooth transition from associate to bachelor’s degree programs,” Dooley said. “We have a dedicated team for working with Ivy Tech and its students, and we are continuing to expand our strong partnership in many ways. It is so heartwarming to see Ivy Tech students when they cross the graduation stage to receive their bachelor’s degree.”
Purdue Global Provost Jon Harbor said one of the most exciting features of the Pathways Partnership is the Ivy Tech Achievement Scholarship, which will provide financial support for students who complete an associate degree at Ivy Tech as they continue their pursuit of a bachelor’s degree. Ivy Tech employees are also eligible to receive a tuition incentive at Purdue Global.
“The partnership also includes exchange and acceptance of prior learning credit so that students may transfer their credit for prior learning between the two institutions,” Harbor said. “This is a partnership best practice that goes beyond removing barriers for students, and it was highlighted nationally by the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning.”
Ivy Tech Provost Dean McCurdy said the two schools have worked to enhance students’ success. Both Ivy Tech and Purdue Global have received funding to successfully educate underserved and first-generation students to improve their employment and socioeconomic outcomes following graduation.
“For all the Hoosiers out there with some college credit or who have always wanted to earn a college degree, our Ivy Tech and Purdue Global Pathways Partnership provides the support and opportunities to use life experience and credits earned to accelerate the timeline and lower the cost to complete a degree,” McCurdy said.
During the past year, both schools have strengthened the partnership by formally developing pathways and stackable credentials, establishing a dedicated Ivy Tech transfer team, surveying transfer students to better determine their educational needs, providing guaranteed admissions and more. Last November Ivy Tech and Purdue Global hosted a summit exploring how to prepare the Indiana workforce for the future.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey. Purdue Global is a nonprofit, public university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and backed by Purdue University. For more information, visit https://stories.purdue.edu/purdue-global/.

"Trustees sign off on 2024 budget, 11th and 12th years of frozen tuition for Purdue West Lafayette","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
With its ongoing commitment to the vision of higher education at the highest proven value, faculty and staff compensation increases, and strategic investments, Purdue University’s Board of Trustees on Friday (June 9) adopted the university’s operating budget for the 2024 fiscal year with revenues modestly exceeding expenditures.
Tuition will remain frozen at Purdue’s West Lafayette campus for the 11th and 12th consecutive years, keeping base undergraduate tuition and fees for Indiana residents under $10,000 per year. The total cost of attending Purdue continues to be less today than in 2012, with tuition held flat and lower room and board rates. By 2024-25, 10 graduating classes will have never experienced a tuition increase during their time at Purdue.
Meanwhile, more students than ever are seeking a Purdue degree: More than 72,600 applied for undergraduate admission for fall 2023, and more employers than ever are seeking out Purdue graduates. In fall 2022, total enrollment reached a record 50,884 and marked the university’s eighth straight record high.
Professional flight program fees are updated every biennium to offset increased costs associated with aviation operations. Fees, which will impact less than 1% of undergraduate students, will increase 3% on average in both 2023-24 and 2024-25.
Tuition and fees at Purdue Northwest and Purdue Fort Wayne will increase 3% each year of the biennium, below the 3.5% maximum rate recommended by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education. The increases will be used to fund the operating budget, including faculty and staff salaries and benefits, scholarships, supplies, services, and repair and rehabilitation. In addition, a new differential for graduate education programs at Purdue Fort Wayne of $74 per credit hour will be phased in at 50% in 2023-24 and 100% in 2024-25, which will be used to support clinical instruction needs and curricular costs in those programs resulting from updated accreditation requirements. A new instructional material fee to provide course materials to Purdue Northwest students at a more cost-effective rate will provide cost savings for textbooks and courseware. This optional charge is a flat fee per semester: $299 for fall and spring semesters and $175 for summer semester.
For the second straight year, faculty and staff merit compensation  at Purdue West Lafayette will be set at 4%, plus a 1% one-time recognition, reward and retention pool. The back-to-back 4% recurring increases are a first for Purdue this century, reflecting continuity through the presidential transition. Purdue also will make major new investments in graduate student stipends for the second straight year, elevating the two-year combined investment to nearly $20 million. Purdue Northwest and Purdue Fort Wayne will have 4% and 2.8% faculty and staff merit increases, respectively.
Also included in the West Lafayette expenditures are strategic investments targeted to the following key areas:
Purdue’s Next Moves and Purdue Online Education 2.0
Research Excellence
Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business
Purdue Computes
Enrollment growth support
Trustees endorsed the following total operating expenditures for fiscal year 2024:
At the West Lafayette campus: $2.537 billion.
At Purdue Northwest: $156 million.
At Purdue Fort Wayne: $149 million.
Systemwide revenues are budgeted at $2.910 billion – a 3% increase compared with fiscal year 2023, driven by West Lafayette undergraduate enrollment increases; increased state appropriation; and growth in auxiliary income, specifically athletics revenue and additional student housing capacity. Revenues are expected to exceed expenditures by $68 million for an operating surplus of 2.3%.

Trustees approve Purdue University Airport runway rehabilitation,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue trustees on Friday (June 9) gave approval to plan, finance, construct and award construction contracts for the rehabilitation of a Purdue University Airport runway.
The project will repave Runway 5/23. In addition, a small connector taxiway will be relocated and reconstructed, and a second taxiway that is no longer used will be eliminated. Work is scheduled to start in May 2024 and be completed in June 2024.
Along with improving airport safety by allowing more distance for aircraft to land and turn, the continued maintenance and operation of runway 5/23 supports students in the School of Aviation and Transportation Technology in Purdue’s Polytechnic Institute and allows the airport to continue its current level of operation.
The Federal Aviation Administration supports the prioritization and completion of this project and is awarding grant funding to cover most of the total project cost ($3,147,625 of $3.6 million), with the balance to be paid by operating funds – reserves.
The Purdue University Airport has two runways, 5/23 and 10/28.

Provost provides update on leadership roles,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Patrick Wolfe, Purdue provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity, announced several leadership appointments and organizational updates at the Board of Trustees meeting on Friday (June 9), as the university approaches the beginning of the next fiscal year.
Following an internal search, Sunil Prabhakar, department head and professor of computer science, has been selected as Purdue’s next vice provost for faculty affairs. Prabhakar’s research lies in the area of data management, with a focus on developing novel database systems for managing probabilistic or uncertain data, and ensuring authenticity and integrity of outsourced databases. He joined Purdue in 1998 and has served as head of the Department of Computer Science since 2010, also helping Purdue more broadly by serving as inaugural director of its Integrative Data Science Initiative in 2019-20. Under his leadership, expanding Computer Science was designated one of the first “Purdue Moves” strategic priorities, resulting in an unprecedented and record expansion of student enrollments, faculty, staff and departmental revenue; the creation of two new majors in artificial intelligence and data science; and a new professional master’s degree in cybersecurity — all while moving the department’s undergraduate and graduate programs steadily higher in the national rankings. His efforts over the past decade have culminated in positioning Purdue for its most recently announced major strategic initiative, Purdue Computes. An interim head to lead the Department of Computer Science will be announced in due course.
Prabhakar succeeds Peter Hollenbeck, who will retire June 30 after a long and distinguished career as a Purdue neurobiologist and administrative leader. The hallmark of his work as vice provost (since 2016, and preceded by two years of service as associate vice provost) has been a strong focus on creating programs and providing resources to underpin faculty success and leadership development. Several programs he designed and piloted have proved of interest to other universities nationwide.
The leading enrollment management search firm WittKieffer has been retained to assist with a national search for Purdue’s next vice provost for enrollment management. The successful candidate will succeed Kristina Wong Davis, who became inaugural vice provost for enrollment management at Carnegie Mellon University on June 1.
Vice Provost Cherise Hall has been appointed by Provost Wolfe to serve as the interim leader of enrollment management, providing leadership and oversight to the Office of Admissions, Office of the Registrar, Division of Financial Aid, Enrollment Management Analysis and Reporting, and Enrollment Management Strategic Communications and Initiatives.
Mohit Tawarmalani will serve as interim dean of the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business starting July 1. Tawarmalani is the Allison and Nancy Schleicher Chair of Management and serves as academic director of the Krenicki Center for Business Analytics and Machine Learning. He joined Purdue in 2001 and teaches courses in business analytics and optimization. An award-winning researcher, students voted him the Salgo-Noren Award recipient as top teacher in the Daniels School’s master’s programs the past two years. Tawarmalani’s research, computational work and practical insights have significantly advanced nonconvex optimization and sustainable process design. He was the founding co-director of Purdue’s award-winning master’s program in business analytics and information management. Previously, Tawarmalani worked in the MIS area of Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co., and as a software engineer in geometric modeling at ComputerVision.
In November 2022, Distinguished Professor of Economics David Hummels announced his intention to step down as dean following the 2022-23 academic year after serving in the position since 2014. The Transition Steering Committee, co-chaired by Gary Lehman, vice chair of the Purdue Board of Trustees, and professor Kevin Mumford, the Kozuch Director of the Purdue University Research Center in Economics, continues its work to identify the next dean of the Daniels School.
The goal of the Daniels School is to reimagine Purdue’s approach to a top-ranked business education that will prepare tomorrow’s leaders and entrepreneurs, grounded in the hallmarks of a well-rounded Purdue education and with a particular emphasis on STEM disciplines and business analytics. The Daniels School will extend Purdue’s land-grant mission to provide affordable and accessible education as a leading public research university, teaching its students a combination of technological excellence and business expertise.
Additionally, the search advisory committee for the next Frederick L. Hovde Dean of the College of Science has identified candidate finalists from a strong pool of applicants and is preparing invitations for these finalists to interview and make on-campus presentations. More information will be forthcoming once dates are set.
Eric Barker, the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean of the College of Pharmacy, will take on the additional role of (acting) associate provost for graduate programs – overseeing graduate education across Purdue system and succeeding Linda Mason, who will complete a five-year term as the university-level leader of graduate programs on June 30.
Earlier this year, Barker accepted Wolfe’s request to undertake a thoughtful study of Purdue’s graduate student programs, aiming to maximize the success of and support for graduate and professional students and postdoctoral scholars across all departments and colleges. Purdue offers over 70 departmental and interdisciplinary graduate programs, including degree, nondegree and certificate programs. Each program offers research or study areas, which provide a total of over 600 options. Purdue will increase the support to these and future graduate programs.
A professor of medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacology, Barker previously served as assistant dean for graduate programs (2007-10) and associate dean for research (2010-17) in Purdue’s College of Pharmacy. During his time as assistant dean for graduate programs, Barker served on the Purdue system Graduate Council. He joined Purdue in 1998 and is a member of several professional associations that include the American Pharmacists Association, Society for Neuroscience, and the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, where he has served in leadership positions for the Neuropharmacology Division.
Mason, who has been at Purdue since 1991, has had a storied career at Purdue as professor of entomology. She joined the Graduate School in 2010 as associate dean and became interim dean in 2017. A tireless advocate for graduate students, Mason has been particularly focused on the graduate student experience and professional development, including a five-year mentoring research and review program to establish standards for faculty and develop resources for graduate students to identify and receive the mentoring they need to be successful.
Master’s and Ph.D. students are the engine that powers leading research universities like Purdue, which is investing nearly $20 million over two years in raising student stipends and launching the Presidential Doctoral Excellence Awards. In addition to driving this funding increase, Wolfe has spent the last five months surveying the overall academic landscape at Purdue, conducting listening sessions with students and faculty, and identifying mechanisms to enhance graduate and professional student support and career preparation while removing administrative barriers to student success.
Barker and Wolfe, through further consultation with students and faculty, will further support graduate programs at department, college and university levels with the following principles:
The North Star is student success. More resources will be devoted to students and processes streamlined for the ease of student life as graduate programs at Purdue grow bigger and better.
All essential functionalities at the university central level will continue, including hosting certain interdisciplinary graduate degree programs.
Since graduate admissions have always been run mostly at department and college levels, faculty in individual graduate degree programs will be further empowered.

Engel led the development of the web GIS technology that forms the basis of a national registry to protect crops from pesticide spray drift (www.fieldwatch.com). FieldWatch, a nonprofit launched in 2010, currently operates in 24 states and one province. The technology is credited with greatly reducing unintended drift damage to sensitive crops. Engel serves on the FieldWatch Board of Directors.","[{'summary_text': ""he has served as senior associate dean of agricultural research and graduate education at the college of agriculture for the past four years . he succeeds Karen Plaut, who earlier this year became the college's executive vice president for research .""}]"
Gallardo named vice president of the updated Office of Engagement,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Roberto Gallardo, director of the Purdue Center for Regional Development and an associate professor in the Agricultural Economics Department, will take on the role of vice president for engagement as the engagement office is elevated to the Office of the President, reporting to Alyssa Wilcox, senior vice president for partnerships.
“As an essential part of a land-grant institution, we are further elevating the support to the overall engagement mission, which consists of at least four units at Purdue for many years: the engagement office, the partnership offices, communications (led by Ethan Braden) and Purdue Extension (reporting through the dean of Agriculture). Now the first two of these offices carrying out the engagement mission will be partnering closer than before,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “As I continue to visit each and every one of the 92 counties in our state of Indiana, we see the impact made by colleagues of all of Purdue’s engagement-related offices.”
Gallardo, who will begin in his new role July 1, has worked with regions over the past decade conducting local and regional community economic development, including the use of technology for development. This work has relied on bidirectional engagement. He has authored more than 100 articles, including peer-reviewed and news-related articles regarding rural trends, socioeconomic analysis, industrial clusters, the digital divide and leveraging broadband applications for community economic development.
“Roberto is ideally placed to help us engage as a leading public research university and a 21st-century land-grant institution,” said Patrick Wolfe, Purdue provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity. “As we aggressively modernize our approach to best meet the needs of stakeholders and partners, this update will ensure better coordination, streamlining our operations and enhancing our overall impact.”
Gallardo replaces Steve Abel, who will retire June 30 after more than 40 years of dedicated service to Purdue in the areas of student education, faculty/leadership development, mentorship and community engagement. Abel has served as associate provost for engagement since 2016 after serving as associate vice president for engagement (2014-16) and associate vice provost for faculty affairs (2012-14). Previously, he held various positions within the College of Pharmacy, including assistant/associate dean for clinical programs and head of the Department of Pharmacy Practice, as well as the William S. Bucke Professor of Pharmacy Practice. He also served on the Healthy Boiler Committee.
“These partnerships rarely form on their own. Instead, they must be cultivated, resourced and incentivized to ensure that Purdue is an actively engaged university,” Wilcox said. “This updated engagement model will continue to foster relationships between the Purdue administration, faculty, staff and students across our system and with public and private partners in Indiana, nationally and globally. Now is the time to reimagine how we engage as a university, recognizing its past success and positioning partnerships and engagement as an essential contributor to Purdue University’s persistent pursuit of excellence at scale.”
Gallardo and Wilcox will work closely with Purdue’s new dean of agriculture and other stakeholders to identify ideal leadership and best practices for both Engagement and Extension to create a successful future for the organizations and to effectively serve the people of Indiana and the nation.
“I am grateful for this opportunity,” Gallardo said. “I have seen first-hand how impactful Purdue’s bidirectional engagement is and look forward to building on what is already being done and taking it to the next level.”
With this update, the Purdue Conferences division of the current engagement office will move to Administrative Operations, reporting to Zane Reif, senior director of the Purdue Memorial Union under the leadership of Robert D. Wynkoop, vice president of administrative operations.

Purdue Applied Research Institute opens $41M Hypersonics and Applied Research Facility,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue Applied Research Institute (PARI), the applied research arm of Purdue University, on Tuesday (June 6) officially opened a new facility dedicated to enhancing Purdue’s world-leading capabilities in hypersonics evaluation and testing.
Leaders from Purdue, federal government and industry joined PARI leadership and staff in celebrating the opening of the Hypersonics and Applied Research Facility (HARF), a $41 million, 65,000-square-foot building that is home to two cutting-edge wind tunnels – the only Mach 8 quiet wind tunnel in the world and the hypersonic pulse (HYPULSE) reflected shock/expansion tunnel.
It is also home to the Hypersonics Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center (HAMTC), a single location for industry partners to work on materials and manufacturing innovations and provide access to testing capabilities.
“The Hypersonic Applied Research Facility is an investment in test and evaluation and research capabilities that this country desperately needs,” said Mark Lewis, chief executive officer for PARI. “Through facilities such as HARF, we will help solve some of the most challenging and relevant problems in the field of high-speed flight while also building the future workforce.”
The tunnels recreate different scenarios, such as spacecraft re-entry or missile flight through the atmosphere, as well as replicating unique engine conditions for extremely high-speed propulsion. The Mach 8 quiet wind tunnel and the HYPULSE tunnel offer controlled environments to research several facets of high-speed flight. The wind tunnel more closely simulates flight and provides more accurate data than conventional hypersonic wind tunnels.
The HYPULSE tunnel uses a shock wave of high-temperature air to recreate specific hypersonic flight conditions. It allows flight simulations at speeds ranging from Mach 5 to as high as Mach 40. Purdue will be only the second U.S. university to offer HYPULSE test capabilities.
At HAMTC, located in HARF, researchers can collaborate with industry partners to develop materials and manufacturing innovations. HAMTC is the only vertically integrated prototyping center in the nation that enables the design, manufacturing, joining and testing of hypersonic components and subsystems in one location, speeding time from concept to full-fledged product.
“Flying is part of our Boilermaker DNA, from autonomous drones all the way to the moon, and in near space with hypersonics, too,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said at opening events Tuesday. “This is a particularly transformational moment with the opening of HARF, and we are reaffirming here today our unwavering commitment to national security and defense, and to growing Purdue as the epicenter of hypersonic research, testing and talent development for the United States.”
Hypersonic vehicles can travel more than five times the speed of sound and fly in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, significantly challenging an adversary’s ability to detect, track, target and engage. Hypersonic systems are a top Department of Defense priority to help protect U.S. citizens and to ensure battlefield dominance as competitors continue to advance similar programs.
The building is located in Discovery Park District at Purdue, the university’s ever-growing mixed-use innovation hub adjacent to campus, which also includes the Maurice J. Zucrow Laboratories, and is the current or future home to co-located companies such as Rolls-Royce, Saab, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories and Stratolaunch, which recently established its Advanced Program Office at Convergence Center.
“What’s important in a (peer competitor) race is going fast, and that’s not just flying high, far and fast, like we at Stratolaunch like to do. It is developing those systems quickly, and that only happens when you have a synergistic combination of design tools, ground test facilities, conceptual design capability and then flight test validation,” said Joshua Stults, senior director for advanced programs at Stratolaunch. “Here at Purdue, we’re able to find that synergy, build on the strong basis of ground test facilities that are being invested in here in Indiana, and then go build and fly the aircraft.”
HARF will also be a training ground for students interested in careers in hypersonic research, adding capacity and expanding opportunities for students to get hands-on experiential learning opportunities. Already, more than 100 undergraduate and graduate students work with expert researchers to design, test and evaluate equipment in real-world conditions.
“Students will be involved with research at HARF in almost every step of the way,” Lewis said. “Universities aren’t just places that present new knowledge, they’re places that create new knowledge, and students are essential to that. One of the things you see here at Purdue is that students at all levels – PhD, graduate and undergraduate students – are involved in research directly and will be involved directly in the activities at HARF.”
The Purdue Applied Research Institute (PARI) is a nonprofit entity that extends the reach and impact of Purdue University’s deep research strengths and top-ranked academic programs in engineering, agriculture, science and technology. PARI works to improve national security, global development, infrastructure solutions and to accelerate critical technologies. Through applied research and program personnel, state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure, PARI significantly enhances Purdue’s ability to translate discoveries into innovative solutions and services for mission-oriented government, industry, NGO and foundation partners. pari.purdue.edu

AI-driven mobile health algorithm uses phone camera to detect blood vessel oxygen levels,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
You may already use your smartphone for remote medical appointments. Why not use some of the onboard sensors to gather medical data? That’s the idea behind AI-driven technology developed at Purdue University that could use a smartphone camera to detect and diagnose medical conditions like anemia faster and more accurately than highly specialized medical equipment being developed for the task.
“There are at least 15 different sensors in your smartphone, and our goal is to take advantage of those sensors so people can access health care outside of a doctor’s office,” said lead researcher Young Kim, professor and associate head for research in Purdue’s Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. “To the best of our knowledge, we believe that we demonstrated the fastest hemodynamic imaging in existence, using a commercially available smartphone.”
While a smartphone camera is convenient, it captures measurements of only red, green and blue wavelengths of light in each pixel, limiting its medical utility. Hyperspectral imaging can capture all wavelengths of visible light in each pixel and could be used to detect a variety of skin and retinal conditions and some cancers. Researchers are exploring hyperspectral imaging health care applications, but most of the work is aimed at improving specialized equipment, which is relatively bulky, slow and expensive. By pairing deep learning and statistical techniques with their knowledge of light-tissue interactions, Purdue researchers are able to reconstruct the full spectrum of visible light in each pixel of an ordinary smartphone camera image. The patent-pending approach, from a lab with expertise in mobile health, could improve access to health care.
As reported in PNAS Nexus, the team tested its method against commercially available hyperspectral imaging equipment when gathering information about the movement of blood oxygen in volunteers’ eyelids, in models meant to mimic human tissue, and in a chick embryo. Results show the smartphone camera produced hyperspectral information more quickly, more cheaply and just as accurately as those captured using specialized equipment. The smartphone approach can produce images in a single millisecond that would take conventional hyperspectral imaging three minutes to capture.
Kim said the work reported in PNAS Nexus focused on building the smartphone hyperspectral imaging algorithm rather than specific applications. But in other studies, the team has used its approach to measure blood hemoglobin for tissue oximetry and inflammation. Kim’s lab used a computational approach that the researchers have dubbed “hyperspectral learning.”
The process begins with a smartphone camera on an ultra-slow-motion setting that produces video at about 1,000 frames per second. Each pixel in each frame contains information for red, green and blue color intensity. The information is fed through a machine learning algorithm that infers full-spectrum information for each pixel. That is used to produce the measurements of blood flow, particularly of the amount of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in each pixel. These hemodynamic parameters can also be used to produce images and video that show oxygen saturation in their subjects over time.
As with conventional machine learning, the team trains its algorithms on a data set, feeding it smartphone images and the corresponding hyperspectral images and fine-tuning the algorithm until it can predict the correct relationship between the two data sets. But by building the algorithms with equations derived from tissue optics – an approach sometimes called “informed learning” – the researchers require a far smaller training data set.
And whereas conventional hyperspectral imaging equipment must gather massive amounts of data, limiting either the spectral resolution or temporal resolution, the team’s approach begins with video files that are hundreds of times smaller than hyperspectral imaging files, allowing them to maintain a high standard on both fronts.
“Usually there’s a trade-off to collect this information in an efficient manner. But with our approach, we have high spatial and spectral resolution at the same time,” said Yuhyun Ji, first author and a graduate student in Kim’s lab, which is currently working on applying this method to other mobile health applications, such as cervix colposcopy and retinal fundus imaging.
Kim disclosed his innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent to protect the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in further developing or commercializing the innovation should contact Patrick Finnerty, senior business development manager, PWFinnerty@prf.org about 2019-KIM-68586.
“MHealth hyperspectral learning for instantaneous spatiospectral imaging of hemodynamics” was produced with support from the National Institutes of Health and the Ralph W. and Grace M. Showalter Trust.

"EPICS team designs, creates and donates bronze marker to honor Civil War hero","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Thanks to a group of Purdue University engineering students, Lafayette’s Greenbush Cemetery has a new historical marker that pays tribute to a local Civil War colonel.
The Engineering Projects in Community Service MSE (materials engineering) Bronze Team, composed of students from various majors, is committed to creating plaques for historical sites and memorials. In its most recent project, the group partnered with community leaders to design and create a plaque to honor Col. William Carroll, commander of the 10th Indiana Infantry and highest-ranked Tippecanoe County officer. He was killed in 1863 at the Battle of Chickamauga in Tennessee.
Rachel Hruby, who graduated in May with her bachelor’s degree in materials engineering, led two groups of students to complete the plaque, which was dedicated at Greenbush Cemetery on April 27.
EPICS is a program in which teams of undergraduates design, build and deploy real systems to solve engineering-based problems for local community service and education organizations.

Treatment creates steel alloys with superior strength and plasticity,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A new treatment tested on a high-quality steel alloy produces extraordinary strength and plasticity, two traits that must typically be balanced rather than combined. Ultra-fine metal grains that the treatment produced in the outermost layer of steel appear to stretch, rotate and then elongate under strain, conferring super-plasticity in a way that Purdue University researchers cannot fully explain.
The researchers treated T-91, a modified steel alloy that is used in nuclear and petrochemical applications, but said the treatment could be used in other places where strong, ductile steel would be beneficial, such as car axles, suspension cables and other structural components. The research, which was conducted in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories and has been patented, appeared Wednesday (May 31) in Science Advances.
More intriguing even than the immediate result of a stronger, more plastic variant of T-91 are observations made at Sandia showing characteristics of what the team is calling a “nanolaminate” of ultra-fine metal grains the treatment created in a region extending from the surface to a depth of about 200 microns. Microscopy images show an unexpected deformation of the treated steel – dubbed G-T91 (or gradient T91) —as it is subjected to increasing stress, said Xinghang Zhang, lead author and a professor in the School of Materials Engineering at Purdue.
“This is a complex process, and the research community has not seen this phenomenon before,” Zhang said. “By definition, the G-T91 is showing super-plasticity, but the exact mechanism that allows this is unclear.”
Metals like steel may look monolithic to the naked eye, but when greatly magnified, a metal bar reveals itself to be a conglomeration of individual crystals called grains. When a metal is subjected to strain, the grains are able deform in such a way that the metallic structure is maintained without rupturing, allowing the metal to stretch and bend. Larger grains can accommodate greater strain than smaller grains, the foundation to a fixed trade-off between large-grain deformable metals and small-grain strong metals.
In the Science Advances paper, lead author Zhongxia Shang, a former graduate student in Zhang’s lab, used compressive and shear stresses to break large grains at the surface of a T-91 sample into smaller grains. A cross-section of the sample shows that grain sizes increase from the surface, where the smallest ultra-fine grains are less than 100 nanometers in size, into the center of the material, where grains are 10 to 100 times larger.
The modified G-T91 sample had a yield strength of about 700 megapascals, a unit of tension stress, and withstood a uniform strain of about 10%, a significant improvement over the combined strength and plasticity that can be reached with standard T-91.
“This is the beauty of the structure; the center is soft so it can sustain plasticity but, by introducing the nanolaminate, the surface has become much harder,” said Shang, now a research staff scientist at Purdue’s Birck Nanotechnology Center. “If you then create this gradient, with the large grains in the center and nanograins in the surface, they deform synergistically. The large grains take care of the stretching, and the small grains accommodate the stress. And now you can make a material that has a combination of strength and ductility.”
While the research team had hypothesized that the gradient nanostructured G-T91 would perform better than standard T-91, scanning electron microscopy images taken at intervals during the tension testing reveal a mystery. Electron backscattered diffraction images taken at a scanning electron microscope at Sandia show how grains in the nanolaminate of the G-T91 change at increasing intervals of true strain, a measure of plasticity, from 0% to 120%. At the beginning of the process, the grains are vertical, with a shape the team describes as lenticular. But as strain increases, they appear to stretch into a more globular shape, then rotate, and finally, elongate horizontally.
Zhang said the images show the interface between the grains – called the grain boundary – moving, allowing the grains to stretch and rotate and enabling the steel itself to deform plastically. The team has secured funding from the National Science Foundation to investigate the rules governing this movement in the grain boundaries, which could make it possible to understand the intriguing deformation behavior of gradient materials.
“If we know how they move and why they move, maybe we can find a better way to arrange the grains. We don’t know how to do it yet, but it’s opened a very interesting potential,” Zhang said.
“Gradient Nanostructure Steel With Superior Tensile Plasticity” was made possible with support from National Science Foundation. Research conducted at Sandia was supported by a user proposal at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, an Office of Science user facility operated for the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science. Zhang and Shang were joined by Tianyi Sun, Jie Ding, Nicholas A. Richter and Haiyan Wang at Purdue, and by Sandia researchers Nathan M. Heckman, Benjamin C. White, Brad L. Boyce and Khalid Hattar, who were supported by U.S. Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Sciences.
Zhang disclosed his innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which applied for and received a patent to protect the intellectual property. Industry partners seeking to further develop or commercialize the work can contact Parag Vasekar, psvasekar@prf.org, about 2019-ZHAN-68391.

Software supply chain security risks are here: Are we equipped to act accordingly? Purdue tandem tackles thorny cybersecurity issue,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Two Purdue University researchers are taking aim at the growing surge of supply chain attacks, particularly those directed at third-party software suppliers and vendors connected to the actual target.
Sabine Brunswicker, a professor of digital innovation and communication, is collaborating with Santiago Torres-Arias, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, to better understand the way the software supply chains are structured to develop solutions for combating cybersecurity attacks that emerge from the use of open-source software.
To leverage their Purdue efforts, Brunswicker and Torres-Arias received a coveted donation from Google totaling $200,000 to advance their research in this space. The two also are affiliated with the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS) at Purdue.
“It is undeniable that software supply chain security requires immediate and bold action to protect software — and hardware — users everywhere,” says Brunswicker, who has joint appointments in Purdue Polytechnic Institute and the College of Liberal Arts. “As opposed to the clear visibility of compromises after the fact, however, there is very little existing work in understanding and modeling the way the software supply chains themselves are structured.
“Today, we lack the proper models and tools to measure and predict the risk for software vulnerabilities that emerge from reusing software technologies and development environments across multiple technical and institutional boundaries.”
A supply chain attack is the breach and compromise of goods, services or technology supplied by a vendor to a customer, which introduces a risk to the customer base. While the risk to an organization can vary, the prevalence of such attacks has prompted the development of processes to improve the security posture of software companies, Brunswicker and Torres-Arias say.
With the rise in the number of digital supply chain attacks and the havoc they can wreak on major industry sectors and the overall economy, the work by the Purdue duo is especially timely:
According to technological research and consulting giant Gartner Inc., 45% of global organizations are projected to experience a software supply chain attack by 2025, a threefold jump from 2021.
In a major cybersecurity wakeup call, attackers in December 2020 added malware to signed versions of SolarWinds’ supplier software, which was used to infiltrate 18,000 government and private organizations.
Because there are open-source components throughout the software lifecycle, Brunswicker and Torres-Arias explain, organizations need to first secure the open-source software they use. Enterprises and agencies, for example, use an average of more than 40,000 open-source software packages downloaded by developers, and each of those can bring in another 77 dependencies. One component relies on the other to work properly.
“Major software supply chain attacks such as SolarWinds are central to the conversation about cybersecurity,” says Torres-Arias, whose expertise is in secure systems, applied cryptography and software supply chain security. “The hack of SolarWinds’ software more than two years ago pushed the threat of software supply chain attacks to the front of security conversations, but is anything being done?”
Building on the Google research grant, their efforts are now focused on these key factors:
Design a graph-based model for data-driven prediction of risk and vulnerabilities that represents the overall software supply chain from multiple interdependent relationships among products, packages, developers, users, organizations and jurisdiction.
Develop tools to mine software supply chain data in real time for developing and using models that quantify and predict software supply chain risks.
Build a publicly accessible platform that integrates tools that can help inform and enable early action to mitigate risks and prevent future software supply chain attacks.
Brunswicker emphasizes a holistic approach is needed to address this challenge, noting software supply chain structures have received very little exploration by all of industry, government and academia. This is made even more difficult because software supply chains are vast networks of highly interconnected components that span different organizations, or open-source groups, with broad and complex jurisdictions, motivations and practices.
“They often cross software domains — from Internet of Things to the cloud, or from medical to high-performance computers. So, analyzing them is an enormous undertaking,” says Brunswicker, who is founder and director of the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation at Purdue. “Their impact also is subjected to geopolitical motivations and, much like regular supply chains, they require cooperation between otherwise geopolitical rivals.”
Brunswicker and Torres-Arias are actively seeking doctoral, postdoctoral and even undergraduate students to join their team for this effort. The interdisciplinary project integrates knowledge and theories for software engineering, cybersecurity, computational and network science, artificial intelligence/machine language and social sciences.
A computational social scientist, Brunswicker is focused on bridging social and behavioral science and computing when studying open and digital forms of innovation. In her work, she designs and examines systems and technologies that support digital innovation with respect to their technological and behavioral impact. She and her team use computational techniques and AI/ML to model and predict such impact. Her emphasis is in areas such as open-source software communities, data science contests, crowdsourcing, computational models of individual and collective intelligence, and human-AI teaming models for unmanned aerial vehicles.
Brunswicker also manages IronHacks, a virtual hacking community centered on a Purdue-developed competition platform that explores a variety of data science models using statistics from past human actions to predict future human behavior.

Independence Science and ViewPlus Technologies partner to create science access tools for students who experience blindness or low vision,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., and CORVALLIS, Ore. —
Leaders at Independence Science and ViewPlus Technologies have announced a collaboration to develop new science access tools for people who experience blindness or low vision.
Mike Hingson, spokesperson for Independence Science, said ViewPlus Technologies will leverage Independence Science’s team of blind scientists to inform product development road maps.
“It is these collaborative efforts between access technology firms that leverage one strength with another to drive innovation to its furthest potential,” Hingson said. “We will develop products that blind people want.”
Dan Gardner, CEO of ViewPlus Technologies, said, “We look forward to making STEM more accessible for all through this collaboration and ushering in a day when everyone can participate equally in STEM subjects in an inclusive way.”
ViewPlus Technologies has developed cutting-edge embossing technology capable of producing multi-dot height, tactile graphic information and Braille on the same page. In addition, ViewPlus offers a range of products that supports the use of ink for standard text and graphics, providing a more equitable collaboration experience for both sighted and blind and low-vision individuals. By allowing the use of the same document, ViewPlus is empowering people to work together more effectively, regardless of their level of vision.
“We have a great deal of expertise in embossing tactile graphics and understanding the challenges that users face when high-quality graphical information is presented,” Gardner said. “We are highly aware of what goes into producing graphical materials that consumers can use effectively. The company’s efforts are further enhanced by the fact that John Gardner, our founder, is a blind physicist who has experienced firsthand the need for quality graphic information in STEM.”
For more than 14 years, Independence Science has designed products that make STEM laboratory equipment inclusive. One is the Talking LabQuest, which presents graphical information to users two ways: sonification, which provides information to users in an auditory way, and transmission of graphic information to the ViewPlus Braille embosser line of products.
“Combined, our companies have the most hands-on experience in understanding inclusive graphic information presentations,” Hingson said. “Working together, we are confident that the best possible products will be produced to provide real-time access to students who experience blindness or low vision and other students with print access challenges.”
Hingson said there is a natural synergy between the companies because of their leaders and experience.
“First, both company founders are blind scientists who know through lived experiences the importance of inclusive access to data visualization tools and techniques,” Hingson said. “Second, both companies understand what must go into a quality product. The combined experience of the two teams will provide the best coding and widest range of capabilities that will help our users break through the ongoing attitudinal ceiling they face as they attempt to study and work in STEM-related fields.”
Hingson said the companies expect to see a working prototype of a new STEM education product that beta testers can evaluate within a short time.
“Between both companies, we have a variety of potential users and contacts we can utilize to get the best possible feedback,” Hingson said. “As product development continues, the sales and marketing teams in both companies will work together to explore, educate and penetrate potential markets.”
Independence Science is headquartered in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette, which is managed by the Purdue Research Foundation.
Independence Science is an access technology pioneer dedicated to changing how blind people view their own capabilities about pursuing scientific careers as well as helping to educate the sighted scientific community that blind persons can make significant contributions to the STEM fields. Where before blind students and scientists only had human sighted assistants available to them, Independence Science is helping the blind reclaim their laboratory independence. Through real inclusion and access to scientific laboratories, Independence Science is evolving the way society views science accessibility and helping blind students and scientists become more successful and equal participants within the scientific community.

Purdue University offers new Medical and Healthcare Writing Graduate Certificate,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
When people think about jobs in the health care industry, they often think about client-facing roles – doctors, nurses, administrative staff and other medical personnel. But beyond the scrubs and lab coats, there are other professionals whose roles, though less visible, are still critical to the success of health care organizations. Medical and health care writers are one such example.
Considered a subfield of technical writing, medical and health care writing is what makes hard-to-understand medical information accessible to a variety of audiences. From writing the informational pamphlets that come with drug prescriptions to preparing the grant applications that sustain medical research facilities, health care writers play an essential role in the function and success of the system.
To help meet the need for skilled medical and health care writers, Purdue University is offering a new 100% online Medical and Healthcare Writing Graduate Certificate. The program consists of three fully online courses, all taught by Richard Johnson-Sheehan, a nationally known expert in scientific, technical, medical and health care writing and a professor of English and professional writing at Purdue.
Purdue’s Medical and Healthcare Writing Graduate Certificate offers students a high-quality, immersive and fast-paced skill-enhancing opportunity that can lead to success in the medical and health care writing industry. The courses cover important skills essential to health care writing areas, including proposal and grant writing. Each course runs for eight weeks. Classes can be taken individually, or students can complete all three to earn the certificate.
“This certificate covers three areas that will get you up and running as a medical and health care writer,” Johnson-Sheehan said “The introduction to medical writing course offers an overview of the career field and several major genres. The proposals and grants course will teach you a fundamental genre that is essential in the health care industry. The editing and publishing course will allow you to collaborate with authors who are experts in their areas but need support with publishing their research, marketing products or services and securing investment for their projects.”
The weekly commitment per class is approximately five hours, making this certificate an accessible option for busy professionals seeking a quick and convenient way to earn a health care writing credential. Courses start in August, October, January and March.
“The certificate offers an asynchronous approach to learning, which means you can complete the courses online and on your own schedule,” Johnson-Sheehan said. “The certificate puts an emphasis on practical communication skills that can be learned with some guidance and practice but are difficult for clients and employers to find among writers and editors.”
Though medical and health care writing has always been a vital component of the health care industry, the field has experienced a lot of growth recently. New tests, drugs and treatments for COVID-19 increased demand for medical writers who can create instruction manuals for patients (for example, the instructions that come with at-home rapid COVID tests). Medical grant writers are also in demand due to the large amount of research being conducted on COVID-19 and variant diseases as well as other diseases.
Demand for medical and health care writers is also on the rise in the medical regulatory compliance industry. Medical writers play a key role in preparing documentation for patents, regulatory filings and grants – particularly in the biopharmaceutical industry.
Because of these factors, medical and health care writers can expect to earn higher wages than other technical writers. According to an American Medical Writers Association salary survey, the median annual salary for medical writers was $144,500 in 2019. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median annual salary for all technical writers is $78,060. This makes medical and health care writing one of the more lucrative subfields of technical writing.
“Medical and health care writing is a satisfying career for health care professionals who are looking for more flexibility, creativity and well-paid work that can be done from home or other remote locations,” Johnson-Sheehan said. “For professional writers, medical and health care writing is a quickly growing field that pays well and involves intriguing topics with exciting storylines.”

Don’t forget military families on Memorial Day – new video uploaded to AP Video Hub,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A video featuring Shelley MacDermid Wadsworth, a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Science at Purdue University’s College of Health and Human Sciences and director and co-founder of the Military Family Research Institute, has been uploaded to the AP Video Hub. In this video, she explains the importance of remembering military families on Memorial Day. The video can be found at https://apvideohub.ap.org/detail/DontforgetmilitaryfamiliesonMemorialDay/fbcd1fec60d54e33a5b6ad4e57e40867/video?hpSectionId=2293806a10614a0e876a24f1bb66e24a&st=hpsection&mediaType=video&sortBy=arrivaldatetime:desc&dateRange=Anytime&totalCount=64&currentItemNo=0.

AP members may use the video or pull quotes for print articles, broadcasts or podcasts.
Memorial Day is the primary day in the year for Americans to remember veterans who have given their life on behalf of their country. The holiday was created in the aftermath of the Civil War and called Decoration Day but was renamed Memorial Day in 1971. Wadsworth says many people are already mindful of grandparents, aunts and uncles grieving on Memorial Day, but many overlook parents, sisters, brothers and children when it comes to veteran’s issues. To observe the day, Wadsworth recommends Americans attend memorial services with others, display flags at gravesites or donate to organizations that support and create veteran memorials.",[{'summary_text': 'the video can be found at https://apvideohub.ap.org/detail/DontforgetmilitaryfamiliesonMemorialDay/fbcd1fec60d54e33a5b6ad4e57e40867 .'}]
"Emergent Solar Energy starts the engines on Abel Construction’s 210-kilowatt, roof-mounted solar project","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., and INDIANAPOLIS —
Emergent Solar Energy, a leading provider of renewable energy solutions, has launched its latest commercial project, a 210-kilowatt, roof-mounted solar installation, at the Indianapolis headquarters of Abel Construction Company, near the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
The state-of-the-art, bifacial installation spans 21,300 square feet and is expected to generate 287,195 kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable electricity each year, which is the equivalent of powering more than 39 homes annually. The building also is home to Abel Motorsports, which owns a racing team in the Indy NXT racing series sanctioned by IndyCar. Indy NXT was previously called Indy Lights. Abel Motorsports is also, for the first time, fielding a car in the 2023 Indianapolis 500, with driver RC Enerson.
Jeremy Lipinski, managing partner at Emergent Solar Energy, based in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette, said the project is one of the largest of its kind in Indianapolis.
“It is also an example of how solar can be integrated into existing commercial buildings to offset utility-purchased electricity, provide economic benefits through commercial tax incentives and help businesses accomplish their sustainability goals,” Lipinski said.
Mitchell Abel, vice president of business development for Abel Construction, said the investment is a major step in the company’s sustainable energy objectives. It also reinforces the company’s commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility.
“By adopting this clean energy solution, Abel Construction aims to become a role model within the industry and inspire other businesses to embrace solar energy as a viable and eco-friendly alternative,” Abel said.
The solar installation utilizes high-efficiency, bifacial solar panels to capture sunlight on both sides and convert it into usable energy. The project will contribute to a substantial reduction in carbon emissions, estimated to be equivalent to planting 336 trees annually.
Lipinski said integrating solar energy systems into commercial establishments has become a competitive option for business owners faced with rising utility electricity rates.
“This project showcases the tremendous potential of commercial solar power to provide sustainable and cost-effective energy solutions, ultimately reducing the environmental impact of businesses,” Lipinski said.
In addition to the environmental benefits, the roof-mounted solar installation will yield substantial economic advantages for Abel Construction.
“Through the utilization of solar energy, we will significantly reduce our reliance on traditional electricity sources, resulting in substantial cost savings and long-term financial stability,” Abel said.
Lipinski said the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has impacted industry interest in solar energy.
“The legislation has increased federal tax benefits for businesses making investments in solar energy projects and helping create more compelling project economic returns,” Lipinski said.

Conor Daly and Purdue Global join forces for the 107th running of the Indianapolis 500,"summarize:INDIANAPOLIS —
Encouraging the 40 million Americans who have work experience and college credit but no college degree to fire up their own “comeback,” Purdue Global will partner with hometown favorite Conor Daly, as he makes his 10th career start in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.”
The Indianapolis 500 has been a Memorial Day tradition since 1911, making the partnership with Daly a natural fit for Purdue Global, Purdue’s online university for working adults. Purdue University is well-known for its support of military individuals and families, ranked by College Consensus as one of the best colleges in the nation for veterans. At Purdue Global, created in 2018, a remarkable one-third of its 35,000 students today have a military affiliation.
Daly’s pattern of success at the Indianapolis 500 is well-documented. In 2019, the Indiana native finished 10th, while 2021 left Daly with his own comeback story. He led the world’s biggest race for 40 laps before being struck by a loose wheel. Undaunted, a resilient Daly hustled back to an impressive 13th-place finish. In 2022, he again found himself at the front of the field, recording seven laps as the leader before crossing the finish line in the sixth position.
With similar persistence, Purdue Global is built for working adults who want to earn a degree online that they can be proud of and that employers respect. Purdue Global views the partnership with Daly as an opportunity to engage and encourage working adults, including active-duty military and veterans, to not simply go back to school, but come back to Purdue Global and move forward in their careers.
“With Purdue Global in the Purdue portfolio, in addition to our Purdue Polytechnic High Schools across the state of Indiana, Purdue is helping more individuals than ever access real education and opportunity for more,” said R. Ethan Braden, executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer for Purdue University and Purdue Global. “We are thrilled to partner with Conor. He’s a fan favorite, with Boilermaker-like grit and a love for our country.”
The Indiana-born Daly is entrenched in Boilermaker culture, hailing from a family that includes his mother, Beth Boles, a graduate of Purdue University, and his younger brother, Carter, a current student there. With the new Purdue Global logo prominently appearing on Daly’s helmet, having Purdue Global along for the ride allows him to promote two areas closest to him: Purdue and our nation’s military servicemembers and veterans.
“The partnership with Purdue Global is exciting for me, especially given the connection with our family and Purdue’s commitment to our military,” Daly said. “The fact that so many of our nation’s service members and veterans choose to come back to Purdue Global is impressive. Purdue Global provides working adults a chance to earn their degree online on their terms, and the stories I am hearing as part of their new ‘This Is My Comeback’ campaign are inspiring.”
Over the weekend, Daly etched his name onto the Indianapolis 500 starting grid for the 10th time. Daly wheeled his No. 20 Ed Carpenter Racing Chevrolet around the Brickyard’s famed 2.5-mile oval at a scorching speed of 232.433 mph. His effort placed him on the inside of row six, in the 16th position among the fastest field in Indianapolis 500 history.
Purdue University was recently named one of the World’s 20 Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company magazine, the only university on the list, for freezing tuition for an unprecedented 12th year in a row and combatting our nation’s semiconductor shortage by training engineers and researchers with excellence at scale.

Purdue University earns STARS Silver rating for campuswide sustainability,"summarize:Purdue has earned a STARS Silver rating for the university’s ongoing sustainability initiatives from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). AASHE’s STARS, or Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System, measures and encourages sustainability for colleges and universities across the world, predominantly in North America.
“It truly is an honor to receive this global recognition, and we could not have done it without the help and engagement of around 35 groups across the entire university,” said Tony Gillund, director of sustainability. “Purdue is persistent in our pursuit to implement and enhance sustainability initiatives across the university as demonstrated by two prime examples such as our work to enhance our recycling program and achieve the 1869 Tree Planting Master Plan.”
The rating system is comprehensive with hundreds of questions across four major categories: academics (including curriculum and research), engagement, operations and planning, and administration. Last year, the university offered more than 35 courses directly focused on sustainability – including Environmental Ethics, Policy and Sustainability in the College of Liberal Arts, Engineering and Environmental Sustainability in the College of Engineering and Conservation in the College of Agriculture. In addition, more than 140 courses regularly include aspects of sustainability across multiple fields and majors.
On the research front, nearly 270 researchers from more than 50 departments have self-identified as researchers with interest in sustainability as indicated by affiliation with Purdue’s Institute for a Sustainable Future, which brought together over 15 years of research investment and outcomes from Purdue’s Climate Change Research Center and the Center for the Environment in August of 2022. Located within the Office of Research’s Discovery Park District Institutes and Centers, the institute fosters and promotes research, partnerships and engagement in areas including the environment, climate, food-energy-water security and sustainability as researchers work to address some of the most pressing global challenges.
Within the operations/planning category, the university’s STARS submission highlighted, among other initiatives, progress toward the goals outlined in the 2020 Physical Facilities Sustainability Master Plan, including three measurable goals on waste reduction. Goals to recycle 75% of construction waste and 100% of e-waste are on track to be achieved, and progress is being made toward a goal of recycling 50% of all campus waste.
Contributing to the university’s silver rating is the ongoing, innovative work with Duke Energy on a feasibility study to explore the use of advanced nuclear technology to meet the long-term energy needs of the West Lafayette campus
“STARS was developed by the campus sustainability community to provide high standards for recognizing sustainability efforts in higher education,” said Meghan Fay Zahniser, AASHE’s executive director. “Purdue has demonstrated a substantial commitment to sustainability and is to be congratulated for their efforts.”
STARS rating levels include reporting bronze, silver, gold and platinum. Purdue first received a STARS rating – silver level – in 2013, and the latest silver-level rating reflects a higher overall score than the submission in 2013. Approximately 40% of all participating universities receive a silver rating, and all ratings are valid for three years.
“We have certainly made progress over the last decade and increased sustainability efforts in more recent years,” Gillund said. “The specific goals we have in place with the 2020 Physical Facilities Sustainability Master Plan will allow us to continue to make progress and really help us advance sustainability initiatives across campus.”

Purdue agrivoltaic farming structures and software harvest solar power at lower cost and with minimal impact on crop yield,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University researchers have improved upon traditional solar energy structures used in agrivoltaic farming, a sustainable system that generates electricity from the sun while row crops like corn, rice, soybeans and wheat concurrently grow on the same land.
The patent-pending Purdue structures and software optimize food production for farmers and maximize solar energy production. Research about the improved agrivoltaic panels was published in the January 2023 issue of the peer-reviewed IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics. It also has been published in the Journal of Photovoltaic Technology and Nature Sustainability and presented at IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists conferences.
Rakesh Agrawal, the Winthrop E. Stone Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering from Purdue’s Davidson School of Chemical Engineering, said farmland in the United States already is used to generate energy from wind.
“But wind farms depend on the availability of wind energy and are limited to certain regions of the world,” Agrawal said, “whereas sunlight is available at most locations where farming is done, and photovoltaics, or PV, can be deployed at a much larger scale. However, use of PV panels on agriculture farmland requires sharing solar photons between food and energy that must be carefully optimized.”
Traditional agrivoltaic structures cast shadows, which decrease crop yield. Mitch Tuinstra is a Purdue University professor of plant breeding and genetics, the Wickersham Chair of Excellence in Agricultural Research and scientific director of the Institute for Plant Sciences in the College of Agriculture. He said traditional structures are incompatible with large-scale agriculture because they are mounted high to allow farm equipment to freely move around them.
“The increased height requires a deeper foundation for the structures, which dramatically increases the cost of the solar farms,” Tuinstra said. “Our modules are mounted much lower, comparable to traditional solar farms, which makes our system more affordable and decreases the time needed for a return on investment.”
The Purdue agrivoltaic structures use a dual, off-axis rotation system and sensors to optimize the amount of electricity generated and the amount of light that crops receive.
“The key idea is that when farm equipment needs to pass, the modules will rotate to form a near-vertical structure,” Tuinstra said. “At other times, the modules will track the sun as usual.”
Muhammad Ashraful Alam, the Jai N. Gupta Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said the Purdue agrivoltaic structures can be implemented for full-scale farming and use current farm equipment.
“The system is designed with row crops in mind like corn, soybeans, wheat and rice,” Alam said. “The dimensions of these structures have been fine-tuned to allow sunlight, rain and shadows to reach plants as needed. They also withstand harsh weather conditions including heavy rain and strong wind.”
Agrawal, Alam and Tuinstra created the structures and software and disclosed them to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which applied for a patent on the intellectual property. Industry partners seeking to further develop the inventions should contact Will Buchanan, wdbuchanan@prf.org about 2020-AGRA-68784 and 2021-AGRA-69267.
The next steps to bring these improved agrivoltaic structures to market include partnering with a solar energy developer.
“This is translational research. An industrial partnership or partnership with solar farm installation companies, preferably in Indiana, is the next step,” Tuinstra said.

Purdue biology innovation allows the introduction of valuable traits in plants without creating transgenic plants,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Academic researchers and companies in the agricultural biotechnology sector will be able to use a patent-pending Purdue University biology innovation to introduce valuable traits to plants without integrating novel DNA into a plant’s genome.
Traditional Agrobacterium strains deliver transfer DNA, or T-DNA, into plants, including crops, and integrate it into the plants’ genome. This can create a plant that expresses traits, such as improved drought resistance or better nutritional content, that are valued by growers and can be useful to industry. However, T-DNA is permanently integrated into the plant genome, creating plants labeled “transgenic.” Transgenic plants can be either highly regulated or outlawed.
Purdue biologists have developed Agrobacterium strains that deliver T-DNA so plants can still be modified to express valued traits, but they are not transgenic. This means traditional methods to remove T-DNA aren’t needed. The strains were created by Stanton Gelvin, the Edwin Umbarger Distinguished Professor of Biology, and Lan-Ying Lee, research scientist, in the Department of Biological Sciences of Purdue University’s College of Science.
Gelvin said these VirD2 mutant Agrobacterium strains can carry T-DNA that delivers and expresses genome engineering reagents, such as CRISPR-Cas. Although the plant genome may be altered, no transgenic plant is created.
“T-DNA delivered by Purdue-created Agrobacterium strains disappears from the plant nucleus because it is eventually destroyed by nucleases – naturally existing enzymes that degrade DNA – or it is ‘diluted’ out of the plant nuclei as the cells divide,” Gelvin said.
The traditional method to remove integrated T-DNA from transgenic plants is to sexually cross a transgenic plant with a nontransgenic plant. Gelvin said this method has drawbacks.
“Crossing can be time-consuming and costly, generally requiring several generations of plants,” Gelvin said. “This isn’t feasible for plants with long generation times, such as many trees used for fruit or production of lumber, or crops that are normally vegetatively propagated, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes and bananas. These Purdue-created Agrobacterium strains avoid these drawbacks.”
Gelvin and Lee have successfully used their strains on preliminary genome engineering of model plant species. Their altered Agrobacterium strains mutated a tobacco phytoene desaturase gene, encoding an enzyme involved in chlorophyll synthesis, at 50%-80% of levels mutated by normal, wild-type Agrobacterium strains, but without generating a transgenic plant.
“There are numerous traits that scientists and companies would like to introduce, but our strains are perhaps best used for genome engineering of any gene,” Gelvin said. “Lan-Ying and I continue to conduct additional experiments as we try to make these strains easier to use in academic laboratory and industrial settings.”
Gelvin and Lee have disclosed their Agrobacterium strains to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for patent protection on the intellectual property. Commercial partners with an interest in developing or licensing the strains should contact Abhijit Karve, director of business development, aakarve@prf.org, about tracking code 2023-GELV-70225.
Gelvin and Lee have received support from the National Science Foundation to develop these Agrobacterium strains.

Purdue signs landmark U.S.-Japan agreement in semiconductors at G7 summit,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University continues to be the world leader in creating vital partnerships in semiconductors.On Sunday (May 21) in Hiroshima, Japan, Purdue President Mung Chiang signed another landmark international agreement, partnering with Micron, Tokyo Electron and other educational institutions in the United States and Japan to establish the “UPWARDS Network” for workforce advancement and research and development in semiconductors.The announcement was made during this year’s Group of Seven (G7) summit in Hiroshima, which also included the Quad countries and other world leaders. The agreement was signed in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken; Keiko Nagaoka, Japan’s Minister for Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; and Rahm Emanuel, U.S. Ambassador to Japan. The signatories later had a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden at the end of the summit.
A White House statement noted “the finalization of a memorandum of cooperation on education and technology and the launching of new partnerships between U.S. and Japanese companies and universities, including the University of Chicago and Purdue University, in areas like quantum computing and semiconductors.”“Purdue is the leading American university in semiconductor talent, innovation and industry partnership,” Chiang remarked during the signing ceremony. “We are excited to partner with the semiconductor companies and other institutions for semiconductor collaboration between the U.S. and Japan. We will also launch the Negishi Fellowship in addition to the UPWARDS Network program to strengthen such collaboration.”The May 21 trip also included meetings with leaders and representatives of Hiroshima University, Tohoku University and the U.S. Embassy in Japan.Secretary Blinken said: “To all of the leaders who are here from U.S. and Japanese industry, from educational institutions, kicking off these new initiatives today, from IBM, Google, Micron, Tokyo Electron; Universities of Tokyo, Hiroshima, Tohoku, Chicago, Purdue, Boise State – this is an extraordinary group of institutions, individuals, (and) partners in this endeavor.”Ambassador Emanuel said: “These partnerships are about seizing economic opportunity and strengthening economic security. When we connect leading companies with leading colleges, we position ourselves to lead in critical technologies.”Micron and Tokyo Electron, as founding industry partners, the National Science Foundation and universities together will invest over $60 million for the five-year project. Other U.S. university participants included in the MOU are Boise State University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Washington and Virginia Tech, while the Japanese university participants are Hiroshima University, Kyushu University, Nagoya University, Tohoku University and Tokyo Institute of Technology.This is Purdue’s third semiconductors global partnership this month, following:
On May 9, together with Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, Purdue signed a milestone alliance with the government of India to be a key collaborator with India and the India Semiconductor Mission.
On May 2 in Washington D.C., together with Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb and U.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, Purdue and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation formed a partnership with Belgium-based imec for microelectronics industry research and semiconductor workforce development.
Purdue is now the only university in the U.S. with bilateral partnerships in semiconductors with Europe, India and Japan.
On April 18, Purdue University, along with Krach Institute of Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, the Semiconductor Industry Association and SEMI, organized leaders from industry, government and academia at a summit in Washington, D.C., to forge national solutions at scale to address the future of U.S. innovation in microelectronics and the semiconductor workforce, featuring a keynote fireside chat among Chiang, Young and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. Over 175 companies, government agencies and universities participated in the event.
Purdue continually works to answer the call for semiconductor workforce development with the Semiconductor Degrees Program, the first comprehensive set of innovative, interdisciplinary degrees and credentials in semiconductors and microelectronics in the country. The SDP is advised by an industrial board consisting of CTO/EVP-level executives of more than 25 leading global semiconductor companies and has been endorsed by the CEOs of many of these companies.
Purdue has also partnered with Ivy Tech Community College, the nation’s largest singly accredited statewide community college system, to develop industry-driven credentials and experiential programs. The collaboration brings Purdue’s resources to populations that may not have had access to this type of program while upskilling a motivated workforce.
Additionally, Purdue announced in June 2022 that MediaTek Inc., a leading global fabless chipmaker, would open the company’s first semiconductor chip design center in the Midwest, to be housed on Purdue’s campus. That was followed by U.S.-based SkyWater Technology, which announced in July 22 a $1.8 billion investment for locating a major semiconductor manufacturing facility in Discovery Park District at Purdue.
And earlier this year, Purdue committed $100 million to semiconductor research and learning facilities as part of the 3-pronged Purdue Computes initiative.
Purdue has been recognized by Fast Company as one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies for its advances in workforce development in semiconductors and microelectronics.
There are deep-standing ties among Purdue, the state of Indiana and Japan.
From March 28-30, a Purdue delegation led by Chiang visited Japan and held 17 meetings with government officials, university presidents, industry leaders and alumni organizations. On March 29, at the U.S. Ambassador to Japan’s historic residence in Tokyo, Chiang met with Emanuel and announced that the late Ei-ichi Negishi, a Purdue chemist who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2010, would be honored with the creation of the Negishi Fellowship for Japan-Purdue Collaboration. The fellowship will grow the bidirectional student exchanges and research collaborations between top Japanese universities and Purdue in trusted technology development. The fellowship will be available to both graduate and undergraduate students.
A Japanese citizen, Negishi came to Purdue in 1963 to work as a postdoctoral researcher in chemistry under Herbert C. Brown. Negishi stayed until 1972, returned in 1979 and retired as the Herbert C. Brown Distinguished Professor of Chemistry in 2019. Negishi’s work in creating a method to build complex organic molecules necessary for numerous purposes – from pharmaceutical manufacturing to electronics – led to a Nobel Prize in chemistry. The Negishi-Brown Institute was created at Purdue in 2011 to support basic research in catalytic organometallic chemistry through graduate and postdoctoral fellowships, regular workshops and symposia, and establishing new relationships with industrial partners.
Purdue has MOUs with multiple Japanese universities, including a recently celebrated 25-year partnership with Tohoku University regarding semiconductors, quantum, spintronics and more. In addition, Purdue has ongoing discussions with academic and industry leaders in Japan about advanced manufacturing, economic development and research collaboration.
Locally, Subaru has been one of largest employers in Tippecanoe County (home of Purdue) since 1989. Subaru of Indiana Automotive Inc. is the automaker’s only manufacturing site outside of Japan.
Indiana is home to over 300 Japanese businesses (more than 67,000 jobs supported), and Japan is the largest source of foreign direct investment to the state. Among the United States, Indiana has the largest amount of Japanese investment per capita. Furthermore, many Indiana-based companies, including Eli Lilly, Cook Medical, Cummins, Urschel Laboratories and Zimmer Biomet, have operations in Japan.

Purdue Ventures invests in wearable communication chip company Ixana,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue Ventures, which manages multiple early stage investment funds to support Purdue University-connected startups, has invested in Ixana, a company that provides wearable smart devices with the ability to securely communicate with touch.
Purdue Ventures’ investment is part of a larger $3 million seed funding round for Ixana, including backing from EvoNexus, Hack VC, Paradigm Shift Capital, Samsung Next and Uncorrelated Ventures.
Ixana’s high-speed Wi-R silicon chip debuted during the January 2023 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The technology is based on patented, published, peer-reviewed research conducted by Shreyas Sen, the Elmore Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Purdue University’s Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and director of Purdue’s Center for Internet of Bodies.
Sen said the Wi-R wirelike wireless developed by Ixana has the potential to transform how wearable devices communicate with each other.
“The technology utilizes the conductive properties of the human body to guide tiny amounts of Electro-Quasistatic, or EQS, fields around the person,” Sen said. “This allows high-speed broadband communication among on-body devices to securely communicate at a fraction of the energy cost compared to conventional wireless communication technologies. This allows wearables to use computing in smartphones without affecting battery power or latency.”
Sen said the human body hurts traditional wireless communications by absorbing radiofrequency signals.
“Radio was not designed to communicate around humans because of the high water content in our bodies,” Sen said. “On the other hand, the human body helps EQS fields, making communication efficient.”
The ultimate end users of Ixana’s technology are everyday consumers of personal electronic devices such as smartphones, smartwatches and other upcoming on-body devices.
“Today, every wearable device has its own CPU and communicates only when required because wireless is inefficient,” Sen said. “Wi-R provides a virtually free ‘wire’ that enables efficient distributed computing on the body; all wearables can piggyback off the computing in the smartphone or another body-worn hub without a significant battery or latency hit. This means every wearable device can have access to real-time AI.
“Wi-R reimagines the architecture of wearable computing from standalone devices on the body to a tightly coupled computer-communication network connected by the body itself to enable longer-lasting, more secure devices while making the network more intelligent. In the process, it helps increase the adoption of wearables in the coming decades.”
Ixana co-founder and CEO Angik Sarkar said artificial intelligence has advanced by leaps and bounds in the last few years, but it forms only a small part of people’s everyday lives.
“The challenge is we largely interact with AI when we look at a screen or through voice prompts,” Sarkar said. “Ixana’s long-term goal is to enable our brain to interact with AI in real-time, all day long, while being in our physical world.”
Sarkar said the Purdue Ventures’ investment will impact Ixana in several ways.
“Ixana’s North Star is to make Wi-R ubiquitous in devices such as smartphones, smartwatches and AR/VR headsets,” Sarkar said. “Purdue Ventures’ investment moves Ixana closer to that goal. Further, the backing of Purdue Ventures helped leverage more investors to invest in Ixana. Being associated with Purdue University and Purdue Ventures means more partners and investors believe in the technology.”
Ixana has several ties to Purdue, including licensing Sen’s patented research through the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization. Sarkar and Shovan Maity, Ixana’s co-founder and head of research, both earned their doctoral degrees in electrical and computer engineering at Purdue.
Riley Gibb, associate director of Purdue Ventures, said Ixana’s strong connections to Purdue research is a key qualifier for investment.
“We also recognize Ixana has taken a technological lead by creating the world’s first high-speed Wi-R silicon chip,” Gibb said. “This innovation and its multiple applications will have an impact upon the adoption of wearable technology.”
In April Ixana won the Startup of the Year category in the Mira Awards, which recognize the achievements of companies, individuals and organizations in Indiana’s tech industry. A three-minute video of David Yang, product engineer at Ixana, accepting the award is online.
With almost $20 million under current management, Purdue Ventures manages multiple pools of capital in collaboration with the university ecosystem and local corporations, enabling Purdue startups to improve the world.
Ixana is developing high-speed human-computer interfaces with all-day, real-time, distributed AI. Licensing Purdue University intellectual property through the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, Ixana has developed Wi-R, a non-radiative communication technology for wearables.

Purdue University Fire Department recognizes local business for supporting annual Shop with a Firefighter event for more than a decade,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue University Fire Department (PUFD) presented Jerry O’Bryan, owner of Nine Irish Brothers, with a personalized helmet May 4 for his support of the Shop with a Firefighter event throughout the years.
In 2010, O’Bryan worked with a friend, who was assistant chief at the time, to set up fundraising efforts at his restaurant to help kick off the inaugural shopping event.
“The fundraising event we hold at our restaurant in West Lafayette continues to be successful year after year,” O’Bryan said. “We set up signs so our customers know and understand the cause. It always occurs around the holidays, so people really tend to celebrate the spirit of giving.”
Each year, the fire department partners with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Lafayette for the shopping event. The department also partners with the Purdue softball team for help with shopping. Eligible children and their families join a firefighter and a player to shop at Meijer in West Lafayette and select clothes, toys and other items they may need or want but cannot otherwise afford.
“We are fortunate enough to help around 25-30 children each year,” said Adam Bordner, firefighter and paramedic. “That’s largely in part due to Jerry’s generosity and his willingness to support this program. It’s definitely become a tradition within the department, and we plan to continue it for the foreseeable future.”
The Nine Irish Brothers fundraiser usually takes place in November, with the shopping event in December.
PUFD is part of the Administrative Operations organization. Administrative Operations supports the university through safe, reliable and transformative services. Giving back to the local community with the annual Shop with a Firefighter event is just one way the organization continues to power Purdue.

"Purdue President Chiang to grads: Let Boilermakers lead in ‘sharpening the ability to doubt, debate and dissent’ in world of AI","summarize:Purdue President Mung Chiang made these remarks during the university’s Spring Commencement ceremonies May 12-14.
Today is not just any graduation but the commencement at a special place called Purdue, with a history that is rich and distinct and an accelerating momentum of excellence at scale. There is nothing more exciting than to see thousands of Boilermakers celebrate a milestone in your lives with those who have supported you. And this commencement has a special meaning to me as my first in the new role serving our university.
President Emeritus Mitch Daniels gave 10 commencement speeches, each an original treatise, throughout the Daniels Decade. I was tempted to simply ask generative AI engines to write this one for me. But I thought it’d be more fun to say a few thematic words by a human for fellow humans before that becomes unfashionable.
Sometime back in the mid-20th century, AI was a hot topic for a while. Now it is again; so “hot” that no computation is too basic to self-anoint as AI and no challenge seems too grand to be out of its reach. But the more you know how tools such as machine learning work, the less mysterious they become.
For the moment, let’s assume that AI will finally be transformational to every industry and to everyone: changing how we live, shaping what we believe in, displacing jobs. And disrupting education.
Well, after IBM’s Deep Blue beat the world champion, we still play chess. After calculators, children are still taught how to add numbers. Human beings learn and do things not just as survival skills, but also for fun, or as a training of our mind.
That doesn’t mean we don’t adapt. Once calculators became prevalent, elementary schools pivoted to translating real-world problems into math formulations rather than training for the speed of adding numbers. Once online search became widely available, colleges taught students how to properly cite online sources.
Some have explored banning AI in education. That would be hard to enforce; it’s also unhealthy as students need to function in an AI-infused workplace upon graduation. We would rather Purdue evolve teaching AI and teaching with AI.
That’s why Purdue offers multiple major and minor degrees, fellowships and scholarships in AI and in its applications. Some will be offered as affordable online credentials, so please consider coming back to get another Purdue degree and enjoy more final exams!
And that’s why Purdue will explore the best way to use AI in serving our students: to streamline processes and enhance efficiency so that individualized experiences can be offered at scale in West Lafayette. Machines free up human time so that we can do less and watch Netflix on a couch, or we can do more and create more with the time saved.
Pausing AI research is even less practical, not the least because AI is not a well-defined, clearly demarcated area in isolation. All universities and companies around the world would have to stop any research that involves math. My Ph.D. co-advisor, Professor Tom Cover, did groundbreaking work in the 1960s on neural networks and statistics, not realizing those would later become useful in what others call AI. We would rather Purdue advance AI research with nuanced appreciation of the pitfalls, limitations and unintended consequences in its deployment.
That’s why Purdue just launched the universitywide Institute of Physical AI. Our faculty are the leaders at the intersection of virtual and physical, where the bytes of AI meet the atoms of what we grow, make and move – from agriculture tech to personalized health care. Some of Purdue’s experts develop AI to check and contain AI through privacy-preserving cybersecurity and fake video detection.
As it stands today, AI is good at following rules, not breaking rules; reinforcing patterns, not creating patterns; mimicking what’s given, not imagining beyond their combinations. Even individualization algorithms, ironically, work by first grouping many individuals into a small number of “similarity classes.”
At least for now, the more we advance artificial intelligence, the more we marvel at human intelligence. Deep Blue vs. Kasparov, or AlphaGo vs. Lee, were not fair comparisons: the machines used four orders of magnitude more energy per second! Both the biological mechanisms that generate energy from food and the amount of work we do per Joule must be astounding to machines’ envy. Can AI be as energy efficient as it is fast? Can it take in energy sources other than electricity? When someday it does, and when combined with sensors and robotics that touch the physical world, you’d have to wonder about the fundamental differences between humans and machines.
Can AI, one day, make AI? And stop AI?
Can AI laugh, cry and dream? Can it contain multitudes and contradictions like Walt Whitman?
Will AI be aware of itself, and will it have a soul, however “awareness” and “souls” are defined? Will it also be T.S. Eliot’s “infinitely suffering things”?
Where does an AI life start and stop anyway? What constitutes the identity of one AI, and how can it live without having to die? Indeed, if the memory and logic chips sustain and merge, is AI all collectively one life? And if AI duplicates a human’s mind and memory, is that human life going to stay on forever, too?
These questions will stay hypothetical until breakthroughs more architectural than just compounding silicon chips speed and exploding data to black-box algorithms.
However, if given sufficient time and as a matter of time, some of these questions are bound to eventually become real, what then is uniquely human? What would still be artificial about artificial intelligence? Some of that eventuality might, with bumps and twists, show up faster than we had thought. Perhaps in your generation!
If Boilermakers must face these questions, perhaps it does less harm to consider “off switches” controlled by individual citizens than a ban by some bureaucracy. May the medicine be no worse than the disease, and regulations by government agencies not be granular or static, for governments don’t have a track record of understanding fast-changing technologies, let alone micromanaging them. Some might even argue that government access to data and arbitration of algorithms counts among the most worrisome uses of AI.
What we need are basic guardrails of accountability, in data usage compensation, intellectual property rights and legal liability.
We need skepticism in scrutinizing the dependence of AI engines’ output on their input. Data tends to feed on itself, and machines often give humans what we want to see.
We need to preserve dissent even when it’s inconvenient, and avoid philosopher kings dressed in AI even when the alternative appears inefficient.
We need entrepreneurs in free markets to invent competing AI systems and independently maximize choices outside the big tech oligopoly. Some of them will invent ways to break big data.
Where, when and how is data collected, stored and used? Like many technologies, AI is born neutral but suffers the natural tendency of being abused, especially in the name of the “collective good.” Today’s most urgent and gravest nightmare of AI is its abuse by authoritarian regimes to irreversibly lock in the Orwellian “1984”: the surveillance state oppressing rights, aided and abetted by AI three-quarters of a century after that bleak prophecy.
We need verifiable principles of individual rights, reflecting the Constitution of our country, in the age of data and machines around the globe. For example, MOTA:
M for Minimalism: only the minimal action on data for the specified purpose.
O for Optionality: to the maximum degree possible, each person can choose to opt out.
T for Transparency: in all cases, individuals should be informed.
A for Appeal: a person can litigate companies and the government when the above rights are violated, in an independent judicial system under the rule of law.
My worst fear about AI is that it shrinks individual freedom. Our best hope for AI is that it advances individual freedom. That it presents more options, not more homogeneity. That the freedom to choose and free will still prevail.
Let us preserve the rights that survived other alarming headlines in centuries past.
Let our students sharpen the ability to doubt, debate and dissent.
Let a university, like Purdue, present the vista of intellectual conflicts and the toil of critical thinking.
Now, about asking AI engines to write this speech. We did ask it to “write a commencement speech for the president of Purdue University on the topic of AI,” after I finished drafting my own.
I’m probably not intelligent enough or didn’t trust the circular clichés on the web, but what I wrote had almost no overlap with what AI did. I might be biased, but the AI version reads like a B- high school essay, a grammatically correct synthesis with little specificity, originality or humor. It’s so toxically generic that even adding a human in the loop to build on it proved futile. It’s so boring that you would have fallen asleep even faster than you just did. By the way, you can wake up now: I’m wrapping up at last.
Maybe most commencement speeches and strategic plans sound about the same: Universities have made it too easy for language models! Maybe AI can remind us to try and be a little less boring in what we say and how we think. Maybe bots can murmur: “Don’t you ChatGPT me” whenever we’re just echoing in an ever smaller and louder echo chamber down to the templated syntax and tired words. Smarter AI might lead to more interesting humans.
Well, there were a few words of overlap between my draft and AI’s. So, here’s from both – some bytes “living” in a chip and a human Boilermaker – to you all on this 2023 Purdue Spring Commencement: “Congratulations, and Boiler Up!”","[{'summary_text': 'john avlon: the more we advance artificial intelligence, the less mysterious they become . he says the university will explore the best way to use AI in serving our students .'}]"
Purdue mourns the death of alum and trustee William ‘Bill’ Oesterle after 5-year battle with ALS,"summarize:Entrepreneur, marketing genius, community activist and Angie’s List founder William “Bill” Oesterle was destined to be a Boilermaker for life.
Oesterle died at his home early Wednesday (May 10) after a five-year battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as ALS. See obituary.
He grew up in West Lafayette, raised by highly educated parents with strong ties to Purdue University. His father, Eric C. Oesterle, served nearly four decades as an agricultural economics professor, and his mother, Germaine Oesterle, stopped just short of gaining a doctoral degree in plant pathology from Cornell University to get married.
The youngest of their five children, Bill Oesterle earned an honors degree in economics from Purdue’s School of Management in 1987. Even after he received an MBA from Harvard Business School and established a successful business career — including as co-founder of consumer ratings leader Angie’s List (now known as Angi) — and planted deep political roots across Indiana, Oesterle remained ever true to the old gold and black.
Committed to pay forward for what Purdue had done for him throughout his life, Oesterle served as a member of the university’s Board of Trustees from 2005-10 and rarely missed an opportunity to support the mission of the alma mater located in his hometown.
“I’m not often at a loss for words, but trying to imagine a world without Bill Oesterle leaves me that way. He was a job creator, a community builder, a lifelong advocate for Indiana and a person with an enormous heart for others,” said former Purdue President Mitch Daniels. “He always said I was the person who persuaded him to return to Indiana: If that is so, it’s the single service I’m most proud of.”
Among Oesterle’s efforts to give back to Purdue, he:
Funded the establishment of the Germaine Seelye Oesterle Chair in History in honor of his mother in December 2006.
Provided a $1 million gift in 2009 to honor his great-aunt in establishing the Olga Oesterle England Professorship of Information Technology. This was Purdue’s first endowed professorship in information technology.
Pledged $250,000 in 2008 toward the $5 million Presidential and Trustees Scholarship Challenge, aimed at attracting high-achieving high school students to Purdue. That scholarship challenge was part of the university’s $304 million Access and Success campaign to expand student aid and programs.
“Bill Oesterle fought for growth in Indiana and innovation at Purdue throughout the decades. He fought the incredibly courageous final battle with the humility and conviction that is found in the very best Boilermakers,” praised Purdue President Mung Chiang. “His contributions to our university have been wide and deep. We mourn the tremendous loss to our state and our university community. And even though Bill would not have liked hearing this: We are truly inspired by his life.”
Michael Berghoff, chairman of the Purdue Board of Trustees, said Oesterle will be deeply missed by the entire Purdue family. “I will be forever grateful for meeting Bill. He recommended Mitch appoint me to the Board of Trustees and mentored me during my first year,” Berghoff said.
His love for all things Purdue notwithstanding, Oesterle also is known nationally as the founding CEO of Angie’s List. He served there for 16 years and eventually took the Indianapolis-based company public in 2011. Oesterle stepped down as CEO in 2015 just before the consumer ratings company was purchased by IAC, the parent company of HomeAdvisor, in a $500 million deal in October 2017.
The IAC subsidiary Angi, based in Colorado, helps consumers choose service companies based on reviews and experiences posted by its members. With a list of authentic consumer reviews checked by over 6 million U.S. households each year, Angi remains a major player today in a home-services market that approaches $500 billion annually.
Like many startups, the idea behind Angie’s List is actually quite simple, one of those everyday problems Oesterle faced while living in Columbus, Ohio, as a partner with venture capital firm CID Equity Partners. Looking to renovate his home, Oesterle struggled to find a reliable contractor. And he recalled the value of Unified Neighbors, a helpful consumer ratings service in his former home of Indianapolis. He thought Columbus would benefit from such a service.
So, in 1995, Oesterle reached out to Angela R. Hicks Bowman, the eventual “Angie” behind Angie’s List who had interned for Oesterle at his venture capital firm while she was in college. He convinced Hicks, who was finishing her economics degree at DePauw University, to lead the new company, Columbus Neighbors. The first year, Hicks recruited over 1,000 members in Columbus and then turned to Oesterle to raise money from investors to develop the business.
The company bought Unified Neighbors in 1996 and moved its headquarters to Indianapolis. At its peak, Angie’s List had more than 2,000 employees and annual sales of $326 million, and its headquarters on the east side of downtown Indianapolis comprised 25 buildings, 1,000 parking spaces, 190,000 square feet of office space, a historic diner, a cafe and a fitness center.
Before his rise in the corporate suite, leading to several startups and highlighted by the launch of Angie’s List in 1995, Oesterle’s professional career actually was launched in politics, where he took a one-year appointment in 1987 to lead a new program established by Indiana Gov. Robert Orr designed to boost the state’s international trade.
When that appointment ended, Orr aide Mark Lubbers convinced Oesterle to join him in a fundraising role at the Hudson Institute, a public policy research center based in Indianapolis at that time. Lubbers also convinced Oesterle that a Harvard MBA would have a life-changing impact on his career trajectory.
During his time at the Hudson Institute, Oesterle made another connection to a leader that would shape his next assignment — Hudson’s then-president, Mitch Daniels. That connection changed the course of Indiana history in 2003, when Oesterle persuaded Daniels to come back to the state after serving as U.S President George W. Bush’s director of the Office of Management and Budget to run for governor. In return, Daniels convinced Oesterle to serve as campaign manager for the first of what eventually were two successful runs for governor.
Oesterle’s time with the Orr administration paved the way for another fruitful venture in his home state. Convinced Indiana was losing promising college graduates to other states, Oesterle, while leading Angie’s List, joined with Hicks, the company’s chief marketing officer, and Purdue alumnus Scott Brenton, with another plan: launch the Orr Fellowships program as a way to counter Indiana’s “brain drain” problem. Since its 2001 founding, the two-year program that connects high-caliber college graduates with high-growth companies has had a huge impact on the growth of central Indiana business and the tech industry in particular.
“We’re tossing them out with the hope that they’ll just wander back,” Oesterle told the Indianapolis Star in January 2002.
After Daniels’ first term as Indiana governor, Oesterle returned full time to leading Angie’s List, eventually taking the company public in November 2011, trading on the Nasdaq exchange. In 2015, Oesterle announced plans to step down as the company’s CEO to become “more civically involved in the state of Indiana.”
In announcing his decision to step down, Oesterle said, “I am extremely proud of all that we have accomplished, especially seeing Angie’s List grow to where we are now connecting millions of consumers across the country with leading service providers in their areas. The decision to leave was not an easy one. But as I begin the transition to the next chapter, I have great confidence in the company’s continued growth and prosperity and am committed to supporting a seamless transition.”
Oesterle’s philanthropic efforts include founding Friends of 38th in 2021 to help revitalize Indianapolis’ 38th Street corridor, becoming a co-owner of the former Angie’s List campus and assisting in its redevelopment, and purchasing the former Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church at 40th and Pennsylvania streets in 2008 and leasing it at no cost to Indianapolis Opera for more than a decade until the group could afford to buy it in 2021.
For these efforts, Oesterle was named the 2021 winner of the Michael A. Carroll Award, established by the Indianapolis Business Journal to recognize community leaders who best represent the qualities demonstrated by Carroll, former Indianapolis deputy mayor and Lilly Endowment Inc. executive.
Oesterle told the IBJ the fact that these are for-profit ventures, and not charities, is important: “Capitalism, to me, is about solving problems. If you can do that at scale, you’re successful. I’m trying to line up incentives so that we can face this big problem on the scale of tens of thousands of people. I don’t think you can do that with just not-for-profit support. There’s not enough of it.”
When Oesterle decided to relinquish his Purdue trustee position in August 2010 to focus more of his time on his business endeavors, then Purdue President France Córdova praised his deep passion and love for the university and his commitment to its success.
In recent years, Oesterle led his post-Angie’s List startup TMap, which continued his life’s mission for the state of Indiana — retaining and recruiting talented people. Within TMap’s operations is MakeMyMove, a service that recruits remote workers to Indiana on behalf of clients, including Purdue and other universities and towns. He also remained executive chairman of OurHealth in Indianapolis.
At Purdue, MakeMyMove operates as Work From Purdue, which is being directed by Purdue Research Foundation. Through the program, remote workers from outside Indiana can relocate to Discovery Park District at Purdue in West Lafayette.
Oesterle’s love for Purdue also had creative applications. Leading up to the Drew Brees-led Boilermakers’ Big Ten football title and appearance in the 2001 Rose Bowl, Oesterle, his wife, Kristi, and close friend Brenton reconstructed an old ambulance into their own tailgating vehicle. They were on a mission: to drive the Bambalance to Pasadena, California, chronicling the 2,100-mile trip to root for the Boilermaker football team in its first Rose Bowl appearance since 1967.
For his lifetime of commitment to others, Oesterle was the 2022 recipient of the Daniels Prize Award from the Mitch Daniels Leadership Foundation, launched by alumni of the Daniels administration at the conclusion of his final term as Indiana’s 49th governor in 2012. He was presented the award on Dec. 8, 2022.
The annual award goes to those in Indiana who have “lifted the state to a new plane of thought, aspiration, expectation and action.” In a statement, then-Daniels Foundation chair Claire Fiddian-Green said Oesterle has had a profoundly positive impact on the lives of countless people in Indiana.
“He is an innovator and deep thinker who consistently challenges Hoosiers to think bigger about how we can create positive changes in our state,” Fiddian-Green said. “He is also a bold and fearless advocate for policies and initiatives he believes will help Indiana continue to flourish. Bill exemplifies the MDLF principles of personal responsibility, individual liberty and the importance of private industry, and I am delighted that he was selected as the next Daniels Prize Award recipient.”
Oesterle’s response to winning the award from the Mitch Daniels Leadership Foundation:  “Once every hundred years or so, a leader emerges with the qualities of Mitch. The only conceivable justification for winning his award is that I love Indiana almost as much as he does.”
Oesterle is survived by his wife, Kristi, six children and three grandchildren. A celebration of his life is being planned for a later date.

"Purdue blazed a historic trail in computer science, still pushes the field forward","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Sixty years ago, Purdue University helped drive the emergence of computer science as an academic field of study. Today, that pioneering spirit shows no sign of abating.
Computer science is the largest and most selective undergraduate major on Purdue’s campus, with 2,405 undergraduate and 538 graduate students enrolled as of fall 2022. Within the last few years, the department has added two undergraduate majors – data science and artificial intelligence – to complement the traditional computer science degree path.
Purdue recently unveiled plans for the Purdue Computes initiative, which will provide vital strategic investments for faculty hires, artificial intelligence research and semiconductor facility upgrades. The goal: to help the computer science program consistently rank among the top 10 in the U.S. by the end of the decade.

Purdue’s eXcellence in Manufacturing and Operations initiative meets the moment,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
As the U.S. experiences a resurgence of manufacturing and operations, Purdue University is providing a big lead. The university’s efforts in such areas as semiconductors, aerospace, defense, biomanufacturing for agriculture and transportation figure prominently in bringing jobs and needed technology back to America and in defining the future through excellence in manufacturing and operations.
The Purdue College of Engineering and its campus partners are drawing on a long history of excellence in manufacturing and operations research, education and innovation in announcing the eXcellence in Manufacturing and Operations (XMO) Purdue Engineering Initiative (PEI).
“In making decisions at Purdue, we like to ask how they will maximize our positive impact on society through education, research and advancing our state and nation,” said Arvind Raman, the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering and Robert V. Adams Professor in Mechanical Engineering. “This initiative provides another important arena in which we can help deliver tremendous benefits to the American people, our economy and our society. Reshoring and reimagining manufacturing for the 21st century is crucial to our future as a country, and we are proud to do our part in the revitalization of American manufacturing might.”
The initiative will build a community of faculty, students and industries at the intersection of physical, digital and sustainable manufacturing. Manufacturing talent and workforce creation will be one of the strong components of the PEI, enhancing training of the new workforce and empowering existing workers through retraining in the ecosystem of small, midsize and large companies that constitute Purdue’s industrial base.

Industrial engineering grad: ‘Nowhere else in the country could I have had the extraordinary experience that I had here at Purdue’,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Julianna Hachenski excelled at practically every subject in elementary, middle and high school, from science and mathematics to computer science and Spanish, winning a number of awards. With seemingly unlimited options, the Saratoga Springs High School valedictorian in upstate New York was drawn to engineering.
But her future was not to study at one of the many Ivy League schools that were within a half-day’s drive from her hometown – even after being accepted at 10 colleges including Princeton, Cornell and a host of other Big Ten universities. Hachenski was bound to be a Boilermaker.
On the eve of this weekend’s 2023 Spring Commencement, confirming her giant leap as a Purdue University alum with a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering, Hachenski wouldn’t change a thing about her decision four years ago to attend this Big Ten university. And she’s convinced her time here has prepared her well as she launches her industrial engineering career this fall at Boston Consulting Group in Durham, North Carolina.
“Nowhere else in the country could I have had the extraordinary experience that I had here at Purdue. And if I was to do it all over again, I would make the exact same decision. I would do it the exact same way,” she says.
The oldest daughter of two Michigan State University engineering alumni, Hachenski initially explored computer science, software engineering and business. To test those interests, she took a computer science internship as a high school junior. While she enjoyed coding and problem-solving, however, she discovered a computer science career wasn’t in her DNA.
“By the time I started looking for colleges and what I wanted to do, I was torn between this idea of a background in business and being able to understand how companies think about problems, how finances come into play, how bringing things to market came into play, while also having this passion as an engineer for wanting to intimately understand how things work and how a system interacts on the technical side,” she says.
Visiting colleges throughout the East and Midwest, she intently examined the campus cultures where she would be challenged in her studies, have opportunities to engage with prospective employers and alumni, and – equally important ­– enjoy life outside the classroom. But where would she study? And where would she take her credentials as valedictorian of her high school class of 536 students and a diverse array of academic and extracurricular achievements?
Enter Purdue.
During her campus visit, she was struck by the many possibilities, especially the buzz about Industrial Roundtable, the annual job fair organized by the Purdue Student Engineering Council that attracts over 400 companies and 12,000 students. She learned of internship opportunities, about alumni who returned to campus to visit with students, about industry seminars and other networking activities. Meeting with a sophomore industrial engineering student, she got a more personal glimpse of a fuller Purdue experience.
“Even though I wasn’t technically a part of it yet, I could see that Purdue students seemed excited to be here. They talked about their classes with such an interest and the fact that they got to work on group projects and attend sporting events,” she says. “There was so much more to the Purdue experience. That didn’t resonate for me at other college campuses.”
She was so convinced Purdue would be in her future that she bought a Boilermaker T-shirt and wore it to school the next week. “I showed up to my high school classes with my Purdue T-shirt, and my teachers and friends were shocked and said, ‘You can’t go to Purdue — you’ve been accepted at Princeton and Cornell,’” Hachenski recounts.
In customizing her Purdue experience, she centered on academics in the rigorous engineering program but seasoned that with available social activities outside the classroom. Her choice to pursue industrial engineering crystallized. She loved how it blended the broad business worlds of integrated systems, engineering, information, technology, software, manufacturing and other concepts with that human element. Not to mention the career options.
Confirming that path, she landed four internships with three companies during her time at Purdue – General Mills, Land O’Lakes and The Walt Disney Co. – that provided her the value of 14 months of real-world experience. She gained insights in areas such as strategic sourcing, analysis, industry assessments, budget proposals, software purchasing, supply chain management and more.
“I just fell in love with the idea of being an industrial engineering student at Purdue. It ticked all those boxes on my list,” she says. “And I discovered that I loved focusing on supply chain.”
In between her classwork and maybe a few hours of sleep every night, Hachenski got her money’s worth in her pursuit to become a well-rounded Purdue graduate, serving in a number of roles in her extracurricular activities:
Recruitment volunteer for the Women in Engineering Program, where she put to words her thoughts on what it’s like living on campus for future Boilermakers.
Project manager at PurdueTHINK, offering counseling for campus organizations.
Paint Crew and Ross-Ade Brigade member for student sections at basketball and football games.
Ambassador for Admissions, where she staffed the Welcome Center and served as a weekly tour guide.
Alyssa Wilcox, senior vice president for partnerships and the Purdue president’s chief of staff, and her husband, Michael, assistant director of Purdue Extension, met Hachenski four years ago, when word traveled from her hometown that she was planning to be a Boilermaker. Michael’s family lives in Saratoga Springs, and he and Alyssa during a visit decided to meet her to answer any questions she might have.
“Michael and I reached out to Julianna and were immediately struck by her enthusiasm for Purdue and her drive for success. We exchanged contact information and let Julianna know that we would make ourselves available if she ever needed anything – a home away from home,” Alyssa says. Michael adds, “We didn’t hear from her because, come to find out, Purdue had become ‘home’ for her. As a Saratogian and a Purdue alumnus as well, I am extremely pleased and unsurprised that everything worked out swimmingly for Julianna.”
Still, the transition to the hectic academic culture of college from the bubble of high school was a major challenge for Hachenski. She points to lessons learned in improving her time management skills and how to weigh competing priorities. “I’ve always been all right at time management. But at Purdue, it kind of ballooned on this massive scale,” she says. “I needed to learn how to time-manage. Thankfully, I learned that very early as a freshman.”
She also gained an appreciation for the essential role communication plays for STEM-related majors – and Purdue’s COM 114 requirement for all engineering students. Hachenski can’t remember a week where she didn’t have to give, or at least prepare, a presentation for one of her classes, confirming why all graduates need to be comfortable in public speaking. “Communication is the most important skill that I’ve seen in industry and in my experience,” she says in offering advice to other Purdue students.
Hachenski is not slowing down one bit, running hard through to the finish of her final hours as a Purdue undergraduate. “Yeah, it’s all good. It’s all going to get done,” she says. In the weeks leading up to graduation, she’s done three presentations, submitted four reports and had countless final project meetings with classmates.
“All of that together – the extracurriculars, the athletics, the community, the collaborative classes, the internships, the networking – is really what I found was the most incredible and the most special thing about Purdue,” she says. “With graduation coming up, that’s the amazing college experience that I got to have. And I couldn’t be more grateful for it.”

Feasibility study: Advanced nuclear technology is a potential option to achieve zero carbon emissions for Purdue University,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University and Duke Energy released an interim report today (May 10) that describes small modular reactors as one of the most promising emerging technologies and a potential, carbon-free option that should be further explored to help meet the future, long-term power needs of Purdue University.
This finding came following the first year of a small modular reactor and advanced reactor feasibility study into whether advanced nuclear technologies could power the university’s West Lafayette campus and supply excess energy to Indiana’s electric grid in the 2030s and beyond.
Electricity from nuclear power plants is a carbon-free source of energy that operates continuously 24 hours a day. Small modular reactors will typically produce up to 300 megawatts of clean energy, with some designs having higher generating capacities. They also have enhanced safety features and are simpler than traditional nuclear plants, making them easier, faster and more affordable to build.
“Our early findings show that advanced nuclear technology presents a potential path to zero emissions for our university, and we intend to continue our teamwork with Duke Energy in the next phase of the study,” said Purdue University President Mung Chiang. “The persistent collaboration among Duke Energy, Purdue University and world-renowned energy and policy experts demonstrates the critical importance of this exploration into advanced nuclear energy and what it could mean not only for our campus, but also the community, state and nation.”
In the interim report  no technology has been selected and no decision to build a new nuclear plant has been made at Purdue University or on Duke Energy’s Indiana system. The interim report confirmed:
Small modular reactors are a promising, carbon-free energy option for Purdue University that should be further explored.
Because small modular reactors can operate continuously and their energy output can adjust to meet power demand, they complement other resources, such as renewable energy. This is important for reliable energy as wind and solar power becomes a larger percentage of the generation mix.
Small modular reactor designs have enhanced safety features and are simpler than traditional nuclear plants, making them easier, faster and more affordable to build.
First-of-a-kind small modular reactors are expected to be in service in the U.S. later this decade, and the federal government is helping to fund several projects.
Small modular reactors offer many economic benefits, such as:

Generating millions in taxes for local communities
Creating thousands of temporary construction jobs and hundreds of permanent high-wage jobs
Attracting private companies to locate and expand in Indiana
Generating millions in taxes for local communities
Creating thousands of temporary construction jobs and hundreds of permanent high-wage jobs
Attracting private companies to locate and expand in Indiana
Federal and state law supports advanced nuclear development, but the federal licensing process is complex and lengthy. Streamlined planning, design, construction and financing are needed.
“To reach a clean, carbon-free future, we need to explore a broad range of technologies, including advanced nuclear,” said Duke Energy Indiana President Stan Pinegar. “We need to study this and other options further, and this report starts a conversation about how we might transition to carbon-free power that can operate on demand in concert with renewable energy, such as solar and wind.”
The interim report also explored challenges – such as public acceptance, regulatory conditions, cost competitiveness, technology development, used fuel management and skilled workforce availability – and recommended these next steps:
Advocate for federal and state policy and funding needs.
Federal policy recommendations:
Federally backed funding insurance options
More nuclear engineering and science workforce development programs
A public-private advanced reactor development program
A fuel availability program
Maintaining federal tax credits
State policy recommendations:
Additional support for initial planning and development activities for first movers considering advanced nuclear technology
State tax credits for small modular reactors and advanced reactors
Build on the successful stakeholder engagement to date to continue regional and national dialogue on nuclear energy. Purdue University and Duke Energy hosted a six-part lecture series, “Understanding Tomorrow’s Nuclear Energy,” from August 2022-February 2023. It reached an audience of 4,900 in-person and virtually. As technology and policy advance, additional stakeholder engagement will help ensure a broader understanding of the benefits and challenges of new nuclear development.
Conduct cost and economic studies, site evaluations and additional technology assessments. As first-of-a-kind projects progress through approvals and construction, Purdue University and Duke Energy will continue monitoring developments. Quantifying the costs and economic benefits of advanced nuclear, performing additional technology assessments and evaluating potential sites for development will help inform the path forward.
The process to site, permit, receive regulatory approval, build and bring online a new nuclear plant currently takes about 10 years to complete. If Purdue University and Duke Energy at any point in the future decide to pursue small modular reactors near campus or elsewhere in Indiana, public and stakeholder input will be an important part of the process first.
“The more we learn about small modular reactors, the more potential we see for this technology to help our university achieve a sustainable energy future and eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels,” said Michael B. Cline, senior vice president, Purdue University Administrative Operations.
The Purdue University and Duke Energy feasibility study was announced in April 2022. The interim report released today culminates hundreds of hours of research and evaluation from nearly three dozen leaders and industry experts, including world-renowned experts who serve on the team’s executive and technical advisory committees.

Purdue and India establish milestone semiconductor alliance; sign partnership in the presence of Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University continues to rapidly expand its global boundaries in semiconductors, announcing a transformative agreement to become the flagship academic partner and collaborator with the government of India.
With the announcement, Purdue is established as a key collaborator with India and the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) in skilled workforce development and joint research and innovation in the burgeoning fields of semiconductors and microelectronics.
Purdue signed the agreement Tuesday (May 9) with the leadership of the India Semiconductor Mission in the presence of Honorable Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who is in charge of Railways, Communications, Electronics and Information Technology in India and also oversees the country’s semiconductors program. It marks the second major global partnership Purdue has announced within the last week. On May 3, Purdue, the state of Indiana and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation announced a partnership with Belgium-based imec. This is on top of numerous other Purdue forward-leaning efforts over the last year-plus to address critical national semiconductor needs.
“Purdue is excited to form this pioneering partnership with the India Semiconductor Mission, the first of its kind under the framework of U.S.-India governmental partnership,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “We share Minister Vaishnaw’s enthusiasm in generating talent and collaborating on innovation, and look forward to co-leading the national semiconductor roadmap of our two nations.”
Praising the partnership, Vaishnaw said, “This collaboration between Purdue and the India Semiconductor Mission will create tremendous synergy and impact. India’s vast talent pool will be able to use Purdue’s deep educational expertise and leading research capabilities in semiconductors. This is a truly a win-win for India and the USA.”
With the agreement, Purdue will focus on:
Creating cutting-edge online and hybrid academic programs for specialized training in areas including chip design and fabrication, advanced packaging, semiconductor materials, and embedded system design that can be made available to Indian students as ISM-endorsed training programs, both as noncredit offerings and through integration into the curricula of Indian educational institutions.
Exploring the creation of dual-degree programs in semiconductors and microelectronics with Indian educational institutions.
Joint research and development programs aimed at designing, manufacturing, and commercializing semiconductor chips.
Driving technological advancement and strengthening bilateral relations between the U.S. and India by facilitating collaborations with Indian educational institutions and companies, to obtain joint funding opportunities in the areas of semiconductor research and chip design, manufacturing, and commercialization.
Purdue’s MOU with India and ISM is for five years, with the opportunity to renew. This collaboration aligns with ISM’s mission of driving India’s strategies for developing a comprehensive semiconductors and display ecosystem.
“This partnership brings together the vast capabilities of Indian scientists and Purdue’s rich scientific legacy and resources to address the 21st-century challenge of producing both the research and the talent the world needs to continue advancing semiconductor and microelectronic innovation. Purdue is not alone in working to expand its partnerships in India, AAU recently announced, at the behest of the Biden Administration, a task force to examine and foster strategies to expand critical research and educational partnerships with India’s leading universities. These relationships will be key to the prosperity and security of both of our nations,” said Barbara Snyder, president of the Association of American Universities.
The agreement falls under the Semiconductor Supply Chain Innovation Partnership, signed by the U.S. and India on March 10. It is also aligned with the U.S. and India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) partnership launched by the National Security Advisors of the U.S. and India in January 2023, focused on collaboration in emerging and critical technologies, including semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
Purdue University continually works to answer the call for semiconductor workforce development with the Semiconductor Degrees Program, the first comprehensive set of innovative, interdisciplinary degrees and credentials in semiconductors and microelectronics in the country. The SDP is advised by an industrial board consisting of CTO/EVP-level executives of more than 25 leading global semiconductor companies and has been endorsed by the CEOs of many of these companies.
The agreement marks Purdue’s ongoing global outreach effort to help ramp up skilled talent for the next generation of the semiconductor workforce in India. In November, Purdue and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) announced plans to launch a dual-degree master’s program and an integrated five-year bachelor’s and master’s program in semiconductors.
Purdue has also partnered with Ivy Tech Community College, the nation’s largest singly accredited statewide community college system, to develop industry-driven credentials and experiential programs. The collaboration brings Purdue’s resources to populations that may not have had access to this type of program while upskilling a motivated workforce.
This is another groundbreaking international partnership for Purdue. Besides the agreement with imec, the university announced less than a year ago that MediaTek Inc., a leading global fabless chipmaker, would open the company’s first semiconductor chip design center in the Midwest, to be housed on Purdue’s campus. Located in Taiwan, MediaTek Inc. is the world’s fourth-largest chip designer by revenue.
That was followed by U.S.-based SkyWater Technology, which announced a $1.8 billion investment for locating a major semiconductor manufacturing facility in Discovery Park District at Purdue. It will provide SkyWater with access to both Purdue University faculty experts and highly sought-after graduates prepared to work in the industry.

Building the first highway segment that can charge electric vehicles as they drive,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
If you’ve wanted an electric vehicle but worry how far you could drive between charges, Purdue University engineers and the Indiana Department of Transportation are working on a solution: highways that could wirelessly charge EVs on the go.
An electrified highway in Indiana would serve much of the nation’s traffic. Eighty percent of the U.S. can be reached within a day’s drive from the state’s pass-through highways.
The research team plans to construct a quarter-mile test bed to provide power to heavy-duty trucks on U.S. Highway 231/U.S. Highway 52 in West Lafayette tentatively later this year. In the next four to five years, the hope is to electrify a section of an Indiana interstate.
The results of this study are a step toward figuring out how to transfer high power to longer stretches of pavement at highway speeds and equip EVs to obtain power along them.
“Thanks once again to some engineers and pioneers from Purdue, we’re developing the world’s first highway test bed for wireless charging,” said Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb in November to attendees of COP27, a United Nations environmental conference that took place in Egypt. “Please remember that one. Yes, we will be testing whether concrete can charge passing trucks – and don’t bet against a Purdue Boilermaker.”
As reported by The New York Times, CNBC, Scripps, Popular Mechanics and other news outlets, the research has the potential to define the future of EV charging.
“The goal is to bring the charge to vehicles, rather than the vehicle stopping at charging stations,” said Nadia Gkritza, a Purdue professor of civil engineering and agricultural and biological engineering, in an episode of “Resources Radio,” a podcast by Washington, D.C., research institution Resources for the Future.
The project is funded by INDOT through the Joint Transportation Research Program at Purdue. The project also is affiliated with a National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center called Advancing Sustainability through Powered Infrastructure for Roadway Electrification (ASPIRE). Utah State University leads ASPIRE in partnership with Purdue, the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Gkritza is the campus director of ASPIRE’s Purdue location.
“We don’t envision 100% of the roads being electrified,” Gkritza said, “but we see the potential for dynamic wireless power pavement technology as complementary to an expanding network of EV charging stations that we will see very soon here in the U.S. We feel it would be useful in areas where charging stations are scarce in underserved communities, even supporting transit routes where initial charging at the depots and terminal stations might not be enough and there might need to be some charging in between the routes.”
ASPIRE’s Purdue location and Cummins Inc., an Indiana-based company specializing in diesel and alternative fuel engines and generators, are also leading a project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy to develop an EV charging and hydrogen fueling plan for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks on the Midwest’s Interstate 80 corridor. The corridor serves Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. The plan will examine the use of the wireless power transfer technology that Gkritza and her team are testing.
For their project with INDOT, Purdue researchers are focusing first on testing how well the technology transfers power to electric trucks. These trucks are more limited than smaller electric vehicles in how far they can drive because their larger batteries are heavier. If electric trucks could charge using highways, their batteries wouldn’t need to be as big and they could carry more cargo, significantly reducing costs.
“We’re developing a system that has the power to charge semitractor-trailers as they move 65 miles per hour down the road,” John Haddock, a professor in Purdue’s Lyles School of Civil Engineering, told U.S. News & World Report.
The technology would enable the pavement to provide power to EVs similarly to how newer smartphones use magnetic fields to wirelessly charge when placed on a pad.
“If you have a cellphone and you place it on a charger, there is what’s called magnetic fields that are coming up from the charger into that phone. We’re doing something similar. The only thing that’s different is the power levels are higher, and you’re going out across a large distance from the roadway to the vehicle,” said Steve Pekarek, Purdue’s Dr. Edmund O. Schweitzer, III Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, in an episode of “American Innovators,” a Made in America series by Consensus Digital Media. “This is a simple solution. There are complicated parts of it, and that we leave to the vehicle manufacturers.”
Embedded into the pavement are transmitter coils that would send power to receiver coils attached to the vehicle’s underside. The Purdue team designed both sets of coils and have disclosed their innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent on the intellectual property.
In practice, the transmitter coils for wireless power transfer would be installed in specially dedicated lanes underneath normal asphalt or concrete pavement. The team has completed testing of how well 20-foot-long sections of asphalt and concrete could handle heavy loads with the transmitter coils embedded. The researchers imitated truck traffic by having a machine repeatedly drive a loaded one-half semi-axle over the pavements.
Alongside the pavement mechanical tests, the team also has done lab tests verifying the electromagnetic performance of the bare transmitter coils and the receiver coils that would be built into a vehicle’s underside.
“The whole idea is if you can charge your car on the road while in motion, then you’re basically riding for free,” Aaron Brovont, a Purdue research assistant professor in Purdue’s Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, explained in a Scripps news segment.
The researchers anticipate that it may be 20 to 30 years before EVs can receive the full power they need while driving at highway speeds. It would be up to EV manufacturers to decide whether to incorporate receiver coils into their vehicles.
“The technical obstacles that we need to overcome are not insurmountable. Those can be overcome with proper design,” Dionysios Aliprantis, a Purdue electrical and computer engineering professor, told The New York Times.
The team hopes the results of their experiments would help convince the industry that electrified highways could work.
“We are Purdue University, where the difficult is done today and the impossible takes a bit longer,” Haddock said.

"Purdue receives $500,000 grant as part of new AI Institute focusing on climate-smart agriculture and forestry","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University has received a five-year, $500,000 grant to play an education and workforce development role in the new $20 million AI Institute for Climate-Land Interactions, Mitigation, Adaptation, Tradeoffs and Economy (AI-CLIMATE).
The institute, led by the University of Minnesota, also includes Cornell University, Colorado State University, Delaware State University, North Carolina State University and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium.
“Our ultimate goal is to help facilitate knowledge transfer and the adoption of environmentally favorable practices,” said Bruce Erickson, clinical associate professor of digital agriculture in the Department of Agronomy at Purdue. “We think we can do that while enhancing the productivity and economic viability of farms and the businesses that support them.”
The institute is one of seven new AI Institutes, funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture. It is part of a larger federal initiative totaling nearly half a billion dollars to bolster collaborative artificial intelligence research across the country.
Artificial intelligence enables computers to mimic human intelligence. It is tightly intertwined with data science and high-performance computing. Operating together they accelerate information processing in ways that can exceed human capabilities.
Researchers at AI-CLIMATE will work to improve the accuracy and lower the cost of accounting for carbon and greenhouse gases in farms and forests. In the end, this makes the process more accessible to more people.
“When farmers touch, smell and look at the soil, they can tell if it’s carbon-rich or not,” said the University of Minnesota’s Shashi Shekhar, director of the institute. “By 2050, the United States aims to have net-zero carbon emissions, and one of the most promising ways to do this is using natural systems like forestry and agriculture as ‘carbon sinks.’”
Purdue’s role will be to guide the collaboration’s development and deployment of instructional modules and other education related to digital agriculture and artificial intelligence in climate-smart agriculture.
“We are also going to develop tools for farmers and agribusiness professionals that will help them to better adopt environmentally favorable practices in farm fields and forests,” Erickson said. “Some of these tools will originate from the research part of this program.”
Erickson helped develop Purdue’s Agronomy e-Learning Academy, which has delivered online courses to thousands of agriculture professionals in recent years. His work in online education and research related to precision farming adoption earned him the 2018 Educator/Researcher Award of Excellence from the PrecisionAg Institute.
The AI Institute’s outreach activities will add content to existing courses and possibly add new courses for undergraduate and graduate students. The institute will also develop learning opportunities for agriculture professionals who work with farmers.
“We realize that we need to prepare tomorrow’s generation, too,” Erickson said. That will involve developing activities and materials targeting students in grades six through 12 and their teachers. This effort will include engaging with the National Agriculture in the Classroom, the National Association of Agricultural Educators, the U.S. Forest Service, 4-H and Future Farmers of America.
“Some of our educational materials could have multiple uses,” Erickson said. The materials would need to be adapted depending on the audience, which could be high school students, graduate students or working professionals, for example. But certain core concepts could be usable among all the groups, he said.

"From artisanal to automatic: Purdue tool allows greater control, speed for semiconductor manufacture","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University engineers have developed a patent-pending tool to make the manufacture of ultrathin semiconductors more consistent, controllable and repeatable than traditional methods.
Thomas Beechem, an associate professor of mechanical engineering in the College of Engineering, leads a research team that has created a tool that uses a dry-transfer process to move graphene and other ultrathin, 2D materials from the growth substrate where they are synthesized to a device substrate. A two-minute video shows the tool collecting graphene from copper foil and placing it on a silicon wafer.
“Everyone wants their electronics to be smaller, faster, quicker and more powerful. But transistors keep getting smaller and smaller, which means the semiconductor industry is looking beyond silicon,” Beechem said. “Manufacturers are thinking about materials that are only atoms thick, like graphene and molybdenum disulfide, or MoS2, but the substrates that they grow on best aren’t the best to make devices.
“The challenge is moving the material from the growth substrate to a platform good for making devices. Right now, this transfer is an artisanal process completed in a one-off manner, but workers can’t do that at scale.”
The Purdue tool peels 2D materials from one substrate and places them on another. Beechem said it provides users with more control and degrees of freedom, including creating their own recipes for a scalable process. Using a dry-transfer process, the tool also removes the need to etch materials that easily contaminate the ultrathin layers.
“The tool allows us to control several aspects of peeling samples from a substrate: How much force is used to grab the sample? How fast do we peel? What angle do we contact the 2D material with the stamp?” Beechem said.
“The goal is opening up the parametric space to develop fab recipes for 2D materials in the same way we do for all processes taking place in a semiconductor clean room. Users can try different degrees of freedom – not just up and down, but rotation as well – to find the best recipe for their particular growth substrate and device platform.”
The next step to develop the tool for commercialization is to connect with industrial partners that are pursuing ways to standardize 2D-device fabrication.
“Two-dimensional materials have been darlings in the lab for over a decade now,” Beechem said. “To get them off the lab bench and into the real world, tools must be developed that allow their scalable integration into commercial fabs. Our tool steps in that direction in an attempt to make an iffy process in the lab into something more automatic.”
Beechem disclosed the tool to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which applied for patent protection on the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in further developing the technology for the marketplace should contact Dhananjay Sewak, dsewak@prf.org, about 2023-BEEC-69991, “Mechanical method to transfer two-dimensional material via thermo-mechanical control.”
Beechem has received funding from the Sandia National Laboratories Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program to create and develop this work.

"Motherly love: Sacrificing for goals, balance and growth","summarize:Info for journalists
INDIANAPOLIS —
In July 2020 Deja Trotter used her mother’s instinct as she navigated her family through several challenges.
Trotter, of Indianapolis, had given birth to her younger son, Dillon, earlier in the year. Her older son, Hendrix, was still receiving care for his tracheotomy. She was trying to keep her family safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. And she was starting classes at Purdue Global to accelerate her accounting degree.
As she looks forward to Mother’s Day, Trotter (Purdue Global ’21) and her family have found a new routine, as well as growth.
Following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dillon’s birth and caring for Hendrix, Trotter knew that returning to in-person college classes – something she’d begun before Dillon’s birth — was not going to work for her now.
After finding Purdue Global — Purdue’s online university for working adults — and working with admissions representatives, Trotter was able to transfer all her credits from her previous four-year institution.
“It was a great experience. The professors were amazing. If I had anything going on with the kids, they totally understood; I would email them and let them know,” Trotter said.
She found accessing her courses late at night a benefit. “Once the babies were in bed, I could take the classes and do my homework,” she said. “In some instances, I would be holding Dillon while listening to the class.”
Trotter received help from her mom and grandparents, as well as several nurses who assisted with Hendrix’s tracheotomy, tubes and treatments.
Parents do things to inspire or encourage their children, frequently sacrificing their dreams. Reflecting on this for Mother’s Day, Trotter sees it the other way.
“Hendrix was not supposed to make it, as he was born at 25 weeks and came home when he was 8 months old. Hendrix has been able to strive through all of that. If he can do that, then I can do what I’m doing,” Trotter said. “It makes me go harder for both of them. I really attribute my hard work to Hendrix.”
She encourages all mothers to keep pursuing their dreams. “Just because you’re a mom, motherhood is not a reason to stop. It’s extra on your plate, but it’s no reason to stop,” she said. “You need to continue striving for a better life, for more and for what you want. Your dreams don’t stop just because you have children and you’re a mom.”
Trotter is now at Allison Transmission as a senior SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) coordinator, where she works with internal and external audit teams. She is proud that she accomplished her goal of getting a degree and then advancing in her field.
“I wouldn’t be where I am at without my degree,” Trotter said. “The affiliation with Purdue means a lot. When people look at my resume and see that I went to Purdue Global, they are like, ‘You went to Purdue’ — it has that extension, which is awesome.”
She’s also proud to be a role model for her children.
“It’s important for my children as well. Education is key. It’s so competitive,” Trotter said. “You have to keep continuing your education and keep learning, as the world is changing so fast.”
Danielle Hadeed de Silva, a psychologist and faculty member in Purdue Global’s College of Social and Behavioral Sciences who lives in South Florida and author of “Mama, Find Your Power,” knows what it is like to be a working mother.
“The challenges that exist in today’s society are so much greater than what moms have experienced in the past,” Hadeed de Silva said. “Moms are having to function in a world with social media, where kids are getting their information and being influenced by others. We also need to be present for our families because there are influences as well as drains on our time.”
In her psychology practice, Hadeed de Silva encourages moms to practice forms of mindfulness and take a few moments for themselves.
During class, she always asks what motivates students to come back to school.
“They talk about how they want to be a role model to their children,” Hadeed de Silva said. “I want them to know that if you set goals for yourself and work hard to achieve them, your goals and dreams can come true. They are building a legacy and showing that it is still important to get a good education.”
If children see their moms and dads making education a priority, even as they balance work and family, they internalize the importance of going to school.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults. Currently at Purdue Global:
60% of students are 30 years of age or older.
42% of students are underrepresented minorities.
51% of students have a child or other dependents.
Nearly one-third are either in the military or veterans.
50% are first-generation college students.
After having her two children, Hadeed de Silva said she didn’t make professional goals a priority, as she focused instead on motherhood. She realized this one day when, on a phone call, she used her title, “doctor,” and her son, who was with her at the time, said, “You’re not a doctor.” The exchange made her reexamine her professional goals and think about regaining the different aspects of her identity that she had lost.
“Being a mom is a big, beautiful, rewarding, challenging and inspiring part of who I am,” she said. “But there’s so much more to me that I wanted to get back to. Your interests shift.”
During class or meetings, Hadeed de Silva encourages her students to practice self-care techniques and to utilize Purdue Global or local resources. She also encourages faculty and employers to meet working adults where they are at – especially if they are members of the sandwich generation and caring for older relatives.
“They are going to be impacted by the challenges in their life,” Hadeed de Silva said. “It is a strength to acknowledge that you need help. It’s OK to ask for an extension. They are being real about their circumstances.”
She encourages all moms to keep pursuing their goals and dreams, as they are both equal parts reward and challenge.
“The journey of motherhood is worth it; so is the journey of working toward achieving the goals you have for yourself. It’s worth the time, money and effort,” Hadeed de Silva said. “If you can find ways to enjoy the journey, not just see it as a goal four years from now, moms who are back in school will find it more gratifying and rewarding.”

Keynote to Purdue Global grads: Keep chasing those dreams because you will catch them,"summarize:Welcome everyone, especially the class of 2023, to your Purdue Global graduation ceremony. My name is Lauren Castrinos Bradford, and in the midst of COVID, I earned a master’s degree in psychology when I graduated virtually with the Purdue Global Class of 2020. I live in South Carolina with my husband of 12 years, Keegan, and our two little boys, who are NOTHING alike: 6-year-old Finley is the wild one with not much self-preservation and will do anything to get a laugh. At not even 2 years old, he was driving his Hot Wheels Jeep just as well as his older brother. Dexter is our cautious and quiet 9-year-old, who, instead of climbing everything in sight at 3 years old, preferred to make us ketchup and mustard lattes out of his playhouse.
I earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Clemson University the month before our wedding and soon started my career in applied behavior analysis, working with children with autism. More commonly referred to as ABA, it is a way to positively shape a person’s behavior for them to reach their fullest potential. I worked in the clinic and home settings with families for more than two years until the day before Dexter was born, having no idea the impact my professional experience would later have.
Dexter was born with a long rap sheet of medical complications – including a facial paralysis that required hourly treatments for more than the first five years of his life – in addition to numerous surgeries and countless doctor visits over the years. During this time, I put my career on hold and assumed the role of stay-at-home mom so I could be home to properly care for Dexter. Seven years later, Dexter would be diagnosed with autism. Because of my background in ABA, I knew this diagnosis would eventually come, and I was determined to be Dexter’s biggest advocate and cheerleader.
I am from South Carolina, where we love big SUVs and country music – my personal southern vices being Chevy Tahoes and Luke Bryan. Finley was born when Dexter was 2 1/2 years old. Just before Finley was born, I told my husband we needed a bigger car, and for years I had my sights set on a Tahoe. He said absolutely not until you make more money in a year than a Tahoe costs. Y’all, Tahoes are expensive! One that’s over two years old still costs almost double what most people who live in South Carolina make in a year. I was a stay-at-home mom at the time, so we both knew that was not going to happen.
Fast forward two years later: We now had two kids in preschool, so I was constantly loading them in and out of the car every day. During this time, we were back and forth between our home in South Carolina and Dexter’s surgeon in Baltimore with a 4- and 2- year-old in tow multiple times per year. Cue those thoughts of the Tahoe again.
While I was filling out that last preschool admission form, I read this quote: “In a year, you’ll wish you had started now.” Although I didn’t want to admit it, it was true. Reminiscing, there were a lot of things I wished I had started, or not given up, knowing where I would have been then: Grad school. Taking better care of myself. Rekindling friendships. Learning to cook because little did we know COVID was approaching, and Outback was not going to let us into their dining room to eat dinner. All these things I wish I’d done, but at the time I didn’t understand the impact they could make.
The “stay-at-home mom life” was quickly coming to an end, and it was time for me to decide if I was returning to either work or grad school. I chose grad school because I knew in the long run it would be the best choice for my family. Grad school was something I had thought about since finishing undergrad. I never did, and I wished I had.
During our family vacation in June of 2019, I was sitting on the floor of our room at Great Wolf Lodge when I received my acceptance email into Purdue Global’s master’s program and would be starting in a few months. The reality of attending grad school and being a mom started to creep in. Could I actually pull this off?
Dexter’s next surgery in Baltimore was scheduled just three months away, with at least two more to follow, along with the necessary post-op visits. This meant lots of time spent traveling and living out of hotel and hospital rooms. Knowing how busy the coming years of surgeries would be, I felt like the “perfect time” would never come. After having thought about the decision to apply for so long, I made the call to Purdue Global to push my start date up, and I attended my first class the very next week.
With surgeries planned, why would I start sooner knowing I’d be in lectures and writing papers from a hospital room 560 miles from home? Because I knew it was time to stop making excuses and not wait any longer. As I was reminded of that quote, “In a year, you’ll wish you had started now.” A month after the boys started school, I had made the usual preparations for yet another hospital stay in Baltimore, but this was our first trip with me attending grad school. Thankfully, Dexter did amazing. Finley kept us entertained, and things continued to go well, and we made another trip to Baltimore in January of 2020.
COVID hit two months later, and I was not only doing grad school virtually, but, like so many of you, I was also doing preschool and kindergarten virtually with my little boys. Who else spent the spring and fall of 2020 trying to get your kids to pay attention to a teacher on a screen? I wanted to quit school – or at least take a break. But we all know how those breaks usually end. I knew a year later I would look back, at whatever decision I had made with either regret or pride. My boys were watching me study, respond to discussion posts, take exams and often struggle with no sleep because the option to do all of those things while they were in school was gone. But whether I succeeded or failed, they were watching.
Remember, I told y’all I love me some Luke Bryan. When his last album came out, my life quote shifted from “In a year, you’ll wish you had started now” to “Some dreams you chase, some dreams you catch.” I kept chasing that dream of finishing grad school, and in November 2020 I caught that dream.
I felt accomplished having earned a master’s degree, but a piece of paper and two more letters behind my name were not going to buy a Tahoe. My time with Purdue Global prepared me to spend the next year earning the required clinical hours at one of the top applied behavior analysis companies in South Carolina to sit for the behavior analyst board exam in January 2022.
With Luke Bryan’s latest album, “Born Here, Live Here, Die Here,” blaring in the car, I headed to the testing center to come face to face with a life-changing dream I had been chasing for years. For anyone who will be taking an exam at a testing center, let me tell you this: They do not say “congratulations” or “better luck next time” when they hand you that printout. It’s folded and accompanied with “Have a good day.”
So, with nervous anticipation and a folded paper in hand, I finally made it to the parking lot and called Keegan. I unfolded the paper and saw those four life-changing letters after my name: BCBA – board certified behavior analyst. That was it: The dream I never thought I would catch was sitting in my hands. I am a board-certified behavior analyst.
I landed my dream job three months later, and now I work with other kids with autism via telehealth, affording me the opportunity to care for Finley and Dexter regardless of where we travel in our Tahoe.
Today, you all have caught your own dream you have been chasing for two years. Four years. Maybe even longer. But don’t stop here: Keep chasing more of those seemingly impossible dreams because in a year, you’ll wish you had started now.
Congratulations Purdue Global Class of 2023.","[{'summary_text': ""Lauren Castrinos Bradford earned a master's degree in psychology from clemson . she worked in applied behavior analysis, working with children with autism . in a year, she caught her dream of working with other kids with autism via telehealth .""}]"
"More than 1,400 graduates celebrate their ‘comeback’ during Purdue Global commencement ceremonies","summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Lauren Castrinos Bradford had a short, simple thought as she navigated Purdue Global’s Master of Arts in psychology. “In a year, you’ll wish you had started now,” she told herself.
But then, Bradford, who is a huge fan of country music superstar Luke Bryan, had a different thought: “Some dreams you chase, some dreams you catch,” as her own dream became reality when she completed her master’s degree program with a concentration in applied behavior analysis (ABA) in November 2020 and passed South Carolina’s behavior analyst exam.
“I knew a year later I would look back at whatever decision I had made with either regret or pride,” Bradford said. “My boys were watching me study, respond to discussion posts, take exams and often struggle with no sleep because the option to do all of those things while they were in school was gone. But whether I succeeded or failed, they were watching.”
That is the message Bradford delivered Saturday (May 6) when she keynoted Purdue Global’s commencement at Purdue University’s Elliott Hall of Music. Bradford, from Anderson, South Carolina, spoke to 1,414 graduates during two ceremonies.
Bradford shared her own story of raising two children — one of whom was born with medical complications that required therapy, surgeries and doctor visits. Seven years later, her oldest child would be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. With her background in ABA, she was determined to be her child’s biggest advocate and cheerleader.
“Today, you all have caught your own dream you have been chasing for two years. Four years. Maybe even longer. But don’t stop here. Keep chasing more of those seemingly impossible dreams, because in a year, you’ll wish you had started now,” Bradford said.
The graduates attending the ceremony reside in 49 states — including 290 from Indiana — as well as the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, China, Guatemala, South Africa and the United Kingdom. There are 251 graduates affiliated with the military. Fifty-three systemwide Purdue University employees are among those who earned a Purdue Global degree or certificate via the Purdue Global education benefit.
“Graduates, you continually persisted in your pursuit of completing your studies and earning your degree,” Chancellor Frank Dooley said during the two ceremonies. “The stories that you share with us show that. You have had your ‘comeback’ and are on to the next chapter of your lives and careers.”
Purdue University President Mung Chiang also addressed the graduates.
Kerry Bruso of Windermere, Florida, who received her Master of Business Administration, performed the national anthem during the first ceremony. Gabriela Navarette of Round Lake Beach, Illinois, who received her Bachelor of Science in health care administration, sang the anthem during the second ceremony.
Purdue Global continues to serve people from all walks of life, ages and career levels. It also serves as an educational avenue for the military. As of May 1 the Purdue Global student body includes more than 5,100 active-duty, National Guard and Reserve military members serving around the globe; more than 1,400 military family members; and more than 3,000 veterans.
Currently at Purdue Global:
60% of students are 30 years of age or older.
42% of students are underrepresented minorities.
51% of students have a child or other dependents.
50% are first-generation college students.
Saturday’s ceremonies marked Purdue Global’s 17th commencement since its formation in 2018.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults and is an expansion of Purdue’s 21st century land-grant mission to provide educational access to all people. Purdue Global helps prepare students for what’s next in their lives and careers by offering programs that lead to a degree backed by Purdue University.

NSF funds institute to research AI-powered cybersecurity,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Malware. Ransomware. Zero-day exploits. There’s no rest when it comes to protection from cyberattacks. And in an increasingly connected world, with expanding cyber and cyber-physical spaces and access to tools like artificial intelligence, attacks are likely going to become more diverse and sophisticated.
That’s why a group of the nation’s best computer scientists and engineers, led by UC Santa Barbara with major contributions from Purdue and UC Berkeley, have come together to form the National Science Foundation-sponsored Institute for Agent-based Cyber Threat Intelligence and OperatioN (ACTION). This $20 million, five-year project is one of seven newly funded National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes. ACTION brings the continuous learning – and now, reasoning – of AI to the constant situational awareness and actions that are fundamental to cybersecurity.
“AI is used routinely now for things like malware analysis to identify malicious documents and malicious webpages,” said UC Santa Barbara computer science professor and cybersecurity expert Giovanni Vigna, who will head the project. “What we don’t have are entities that are capable of reasoning. This is an opportunity to bring artificial intelligence and security together in a novel way.”
“The National AI Research Institutes are a critical component of our Nation’s AI innovation, infrastructure, technology, education and partnerships ecosystem,” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “These institutes are driving discoveries that will ensure our country is at the forefront of the global AI revolution.”
Dongyan Xu, the Samuel Conte Professor of Computer Science and director of CERIAS, the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security, is Purdue’s principal investigator and ACTION Institute’s use-inspired research lead. He and five other Purdue faculty members – Elisa Bertino, Z. Berkay Celik, Ninghui Li, Yung-Hsiang Lu and Ming Yin – will join ACTION collaborators from the University of California, Santa Barbara; UC Berkeley; Georgia Institute of Technology; the University of Chicago; University of Washington; University of Illinois Chicago; Rutgers University; Norfolk State University; University of Illinois and University of Virginia.
Purdue University will serve as one of ACTION’s major hubs for research, education, workforce development and technology transfer, leveraging CERIAS programs and initiatives to engage faculty and students, as well as industry and government partners. The Purdue team will contribute expertise in key areas such as cyber-physical security; cyber-physical knowledge discovery, integration and reasoning; and human-AI agent collaboration across the end-to-end cyberdefense lifecycle.
“I am pleased with Purdue University’s involvement in the newly established NSF AI Institute, where our team of cybersecurity and AI experts will work side-by-side toward groundbreaking advancements in this critical and rapidly evolving field,” said Karen Plaut, Purdue executive vice president for research. “We are excited to be part of this transformative effort, and the timing couldn’t be better with our recent announcement of the Purdue Computes initiative.”
Here’s a possible scenario: Cybercriminals gain access to software used by a fictional smart city, a municipality whose water and power distribution infrastructure are automated and integrated. They introduce a software vulnerability that is both complex and too evasive to set off any cyber or physical alarms. From there they use this vulnerability to conduct a supply-chain attack that progressively compromises parts of the cyber-physical system in ways that may seem like glitches and unusual connections, but nothing the threat detection system has been trained to identify. Eventually, they gain access to control systems that allow them to shut down the water and power, effectively paralyzing the city. They do all of this by seemingly trivial actions through encrypted connections that are unnoticed by the intrusion detection systems.
It’s not an entirely hypothetical situation. In fact, a similar hacking campaign was orchestrated in 2021 that compromised several U.S. government agencies by breaching applications monitoring software created by vendor SolarWinds. This type of attack, according to the researchers, is why a more sophisticated type of AI-powered cybersecurity is needed.
“There’s this concept of an AI ‘stack,’” Vigna said. “Imagine multiple layers of functionality that support AI in various ways, such as reasoning, learning, strategic planning and human-AI interaction.” This stack will enable the creation of autonomous, intelligent “agents” that will be able not only to identify a potential attack but also the attacker and also mount a response and conduct recovery.
The ACTION collaborators will begin by conducting research along four main thrusts: learning and reasoning with domain knowledge, human-agent interaction, multi-agent collaboration, and strategic gaming and tactical planning. These research thrusts act as the foundation of knowledge that can grow to handle large data sets, while extracting semantics and promoting inference and reasoning, in potentially adversarial and combative scenarios.
Meanwhile, the AI research will inform and be inspired by the end-to-end cyberdefense lifecycle. The ACTION collaborators will develop and customize intelligent agents equipped with the AI stack to perform four main tasks in the cyberdefense lifecycle: threat and vulnerability assessment, attack detection, attack attribution, and attack response and recovery. While performing these tasks, the agents will acquire new knowledge and experience that improves their effectiveness and efficiency over time.
“Today, any system that has a cyber component, such as a processor or sensor, may face cybersecurity threats,” Xu said. “Adversaries can survey, infiltrate and strike in a matter of seconds. ACTION’s intelligent agent approach to next-generation cybersecurity offers a promising opportunity to out-scale, out-speed and outwit the adversaries.”
In addition to developing next-generation AI and cybersecurity technologies, ACTION will implement learning and training programs to engage K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and working professionals, with an emphasis on outreach to underrepresented communities and the goal of creating a “cybersecurity + AI” talent pipeline.

Indiana General Assembly adopts 2-year appropriations budget: Purdue receives full transition funding for Purdue in Indianapolis along with increases for operating funding and capital projects,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
State lawmakers adopted a two-year budget on Friday (April 28) that includes increases for Purdue University operating funding, as well as funding for the ongoing establishment of Purdue University in Indianapolis and construction of the Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building, among other increases in funding.
The budget provides a 4% increase in operating funding for fiscal year 2024 and a 6% increase for FY 2025 – the most significant infusion of new dollars in operating appropriations that higher education in the state has received in many years. A portion of that operating funding is contingent on the Indiana Commission for Higher Education adopting its new Outcomes-Based Performance Funding formula, which is expected in the next few months.
“On behalf of our students, faculty and staff, we extend our sincere appreciation to the Indiana General Assembly for its generous support of Purdue University that met almost all of the requests we submitted for the next two fiscal years. We are excited to receive funding for all three capital projects in West Lafayette, Indianapolis and Fort Wayne. General operating appropriation is rising while Purdue Extension, ADDL and facility renovation all benefit from the significant increase,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “We continue our commitment to be excellent stewards of these valuable tax dollars, including the transition and recurrent budget for Purdue University in Indianapolis – Purdue’s first urban campus.”
Purdue University in Indianapolis received the full operating request made by the university. For FY 2024, Purdue in Indianapolis is appropriated $10 million for transition funding to support building out physical infrastructure and programs (i.e., student success, student experience and industry engagement), and for FY 2025, Purdue in Indianapolis is appropriated $17 million, which will be the basis for the annual state appropriation in future budgets. Purdue in Indianapolis also received $60 million to fund an academic and student success building that will be an integral part of campus life for students and faculty.
Purdue West Lafayette was approved an $89 million appropriation for construction of the Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building, which will address Indiana’s workforce shortage for skilled nurses and pharmacists and expand interprofessional education opportunities that mirror modern health care settings. Pending formal approval from Purdue’s Board of Trustees, the project will cost $160 million. The university combined with the colleges of Pharmacy and Health and Human Sciences have collectively raised or committed over $70 million in private and institutional funding to complement the state appropriation.
The following line items received increased appropriations:
Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL): increased the annual appropriation to $5 million per fiscal year ($1,288,439 increase per fiscal year).
County Agricultural Extension Educators: increased the annual appropriation to $8 million per fiscal year ($512,184 increase per fiscal year).
Agricultural Research and Extension – Crossroads: increased the annual appropriation to $9 million per fiscal year ($507,675 increase per fiscal year).
Purdue also received funding for the following capital projects and capital appropriations:
Purdue Fort Wayne School of Music building: $15 million.
ADDL Laboratory upgrades: $5 million.
Regional deferred maintenance: $4,224,138.
Repair and Rehabilitation appropriation: $15,101,111 per fiscal year.

Purdue startup Aerovy Mobility develops cloud software to support infrastructure for electric aircraft,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The advanced air mobility sector, which includes electric-powered urban and regional aircraft, may become a $1.5 trillion market by 2040. A new Purdue University-connected startup could benefit airport and vertiport operators and real estate developers looking to establish advanced air mobility technology at existing and potential sites.
Purdue University postgraduate students have launched Aerovy Mobility, a startup company that commercializes cloud-based software solutions to plan and operate infrastructure that charges electric aircraft with renewable energy.
Nick Gunady is Aerovy Mobility’s CEO, a PhD candidate in Purdue’s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics and research assistant in Purdue’s Center for Integrated Systems in Aerospace. He said improvements in battery energy technologies have improved enough to make electric propulsion technically feasible and economically viable. This includes urban air mobility, which uses electrical vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, and regional air mobility, which may use traditional aircraft configurations that travel greater distances.
“The advances in electric propulsion make travel significantly less expensive: Fuel costs are lower and the aircraft may or may not be piloted. These are two of the biggest costs to airlines,” Gunady said. “There is a huge potential with future mobility to spur economic development in underserved locations because of the reduced cost and difficulty to travel there.”
Gunady said, however, that the U.S. power grid is not ready to handle energy spikes related to charging electric-powered vehicles, especially during rush hour use. A paper presented at the 2022 AIAA Aviation Forum concluded that trillions of dollars may be needed to enhance infrastructure that transmits and distributes electricity.
Aerovy Mobility is addressing those power grid limitations with its software solutions.
“The AATLAS planning software identifies locations that would attract the most demand so operators would be able to make back their investments quickly,” Gunady said. “It also assesses the expected usage over time, simulating charging events minute by minute throughout the day. We can size power generation and storage assets, which enables end users to reduce dependence on the grid.”
Gunady said Aerovy Mobility’s VEMS operational software automatically connects users with all their assets at infrastructure sites, including chargers and off-grid energy systems.
“Customers will have full control over their infrastructure site without physically needing to be there,” Gunady said. “We have built automation tools to remotely connect with the aircraft, charge vehicles, minimize grid cost and dynamically price without any user input.”
The cloud-based software suite was based on work by Purdue graduate and undergraduate students who won the grand prize in a 2022 Federal Aviation Administration contest. Gunady, Akshay Rao, Sai Mudumba, Seejay Patel and Ethan Wright won the Smart Connected Aviation Student Competition with their entry “Advanced Air Mobility as an Electric Grid Demand Response Asset.” Purdue professor and Aerovy Mobility Chief Scientist Daniel DeLaurentis and associate professor Shaoshuai Mou advised the team, along with personnel from GE Aerospace, American Airlines and San Diego International Airport.
Aerovy Mobility recently established a partnership with Altaport, an automation software company based in Salt Lake City; Electro.Aero, an electric aviation charging technology company based in Perth, Australia; Greenstar Aviation Partners, an investment firm based in New York City; and Skyportz, a developer of vertiport infrastructure based in South Yarra, Australia.
It also has been in discussions with other original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs; airports around the world; and major U.S. airlines. The company has several memorandums of understanding, or MOUs, in place. It is looking to raise funds by the end of 2023.
“We are looking to connect with companies and individuals with an interest in exploring electric infrastructure at existing airports or vertiport companies interested in identifying locations to place infrastructure, too,” Gunady said.

"US-Europe semiconductors collaboration milestone as Purdue, imec, Indiana announce partnership","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University and the state of Indiana continue to make giant leaps in semiconductor research growth with a first-of-its-kind agreement with a cutting-edge European nano- and digital technology innovation hub.
Imec joined Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, U.S. Sen. Todd Young and Indiana Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers and Purdue President Mung Chiang in announcing the partnership during the SelectUSA Investment Summit, an annual international investment event by the U.S. Department of Commerce near Washington, D.C.
“Purdue University and the state of Indiana have become the heart of the silicon heartland. Purdue is the most visible and forward-leaning university in the U.S. in the semiconductor degrees program, in research innovation to rewrite the economic equation of on-shoring fabs and packaging, in industry partnership with over 20 leading companies, and in national leadership in CHIPS for America’s execution,” Chiang said. “Today we mark a milestone for semiconductor collaboration between the U.S. and Europe by forming the R&D partnership with imec – the best example of successful collaboration across universities, companies and the government. We warmly welcome the imec ecosystem to the home of America’s top four engineering and top five patent-receiving university.”
The announcement with the IEDC and imec is the latest for Purdue in a rapidly expanding resume of investments in microelectronics industry research and semiconductor workforce development. Purdue has been recognized by Fast Company as one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies for its advances in workforce development in semiconductors and microelectronics.
“This is a global piece of the puzzle that marks another milestone in Purdue’s semiconductor programs and Indiana’s emerging microelectronics industry,” said Mark Lundstrom, Purdue’s chief semiconductor officer and senior advisor to the university president. “Future-focused partnerships like this help bring together world-class expertise and state-of-the-art facilities.”
With research sites across Belgium, imec leverages state-of-the-art research and development in advanced semiconductor technologies and artificial intelligence, uniting world-industry leaders across the semiconductor value chain.
The collaboration and equal investment between the three entities will strengthen the growing semiconductor ecosystem in Indiana and at Purdue with a steady exchange of expertise in the continually evolving and expanding industry. A stream of students, faculty and professionals are expected to bolster the already growing semiconductor foundation at Purdue with new innovations and research.
Zhihong Chen, the Mary Jo and Robert L. Kirk Director of the Birck Nanotechnology Center, said partnering with imec will enable Purdue to further strengthen the relevance of its research to the semiconductor industry.
“imec is one of the most well-known lab-to-fab facilities,” Chen said. “They have helped the latest technologies or innovations discovered in labs to be converted into fab-ready types of technologies for industry to adopt.”
Joerg Appenzeller, Purdue’s Barry M. and Patricia L. Epstein Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said imec will have a presence on Purdue’s campus, working side-by-side with faculty and students at the Birck Nanotechnology Center. Additionally, students and faculty will have an opportunity to work in Belgium.
Working with imec falls in line with the university’s recently announced Purdue Computes initiative. The announced $100 million Purdue investment in semiconductor research and learning facilities includes a phase 1 update of the Scifres Nanofabrication Laboratory located in the Birck Nanotechnology Center, an on-campus hub for microelectronics research, as well as global partnerships.
“The creative engine at Purdue is a very strong attraction for imec,” Appenzeller said. “They understand that we both have complementary pieces of knowledge and capabilities, and that we don’t want to duplicate what they already have in Belgium. We want to have something here that is complementary in terms of tools, processes and capabilities.”
Both Chen and Appenzeller have been involved in discussions for more than a year to bring the Purdue and Indiana partnership with imec to fruition.
This is the latest international partnership for Purdue, which announced with the IEDC less than a year ago that MediaTek Inc., a leading global fabless chipmaker, would open the company’s first semiconductor chip design center in the Midwest, to be housed on Purdue’s campus. Located in Taiwan, MediaTek Inc. is the world’s fourth-largest chip designer by revenue.
That was followed by another joint announcement with the IEDC on U.S.-based SkyWater Technology, which entered a $1.8 billion investment for locating a major semiconductor manufacturing facility in Discovery Park District at Purdue. It will provide investing companies access to both Purdue University faculty experts and highly sought-after graduates prepared to work in the industry.
Purdue University continually works to answer the call for semiconductor workforce development with the Semiconductor Degrees Program, the first comprehensive set of innovative, interdisciplinary degrees and credentials in semiconductors and microelectronics in the country.
Purdue has also partnered with Ivy Tech Community College, the nation’s largest singly accredited statewide community college system, to develop industry-driven credentials and experiential programs. The collaboration brings Purdue’s resources to populations that may not have had access to this type of program while upskilling a motivated workforce.
Additional comments from today’s announcement:
This one-of-a-kind trans-Atlantic partnership connects one of the world’s most respected R&D firms with one of the world’s most respected universities. I’m pleased imec, Purdue and the state of Indiana are collaborating in this endeavor.

New building to elevate transformative education for Purdue nursing and pharmacy programs,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University’s colleges of Health and Human Sciences and Pharmacy are taking giant leaps in advancing collaborative, innovative learning for health care professionals in Indiana through a new, modern facility at the corner of Mitch Daniels Boulevard and Russell Street.
The Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building will address the country’s critical workforce needs for skilled nurses and pharmacists and expand interprofessional education opportunities that mirror modern healthcare settings.
Pending formal approval from Purdue’s Board of Trustees, this project will cost $160 million. The university combined with the two colleges (Pharmacy and Health and Human Sciences) have collectively raised or committed over $70 million in private and institutional funding, and the Indiana legislature recently approved an $89 million appropriation.
“We are thrilled to see this joint effort between the College of Health and Human Sciences and the College of Pharmacy become a reality,” said Marion K. Underwood, dean of the College of Health and Human Sciences. “Through the building’s highly synergetic design, this new space will allow two of Purdue’s outstanding programs to learn alongside each other through valuable interprofessional education and greater research opportunities.”
Purdue’s nursing and pharmacy programs are ranked among the highest in the state of Indiana, and the College of Pharmacy also holds a No. 4 ranking nationally for total research funding. The College of Pharmacy continues to graduate the largest class of pharmacists in the state, working with employers to address pharmacist shortages.  The Purdue nursing program has more than doubled in size in recent years to help address the staffing shortages for nurses in Indiana and beyond. This innovative space will permit both programs to accommodate more students and increase campuswide collaboration opportunities to advance healthier Hoosier communities.
“The Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building is paramount to preparing students to stay on the forefront of our ever-changing health care system and to serve as leaders in their field for generations to come,” said Eric L. Barker, the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean of Pharmacy. “The roles of pharmacists and nurses have rapidly changed, with both serving central roles in the delivery of patient care. This hub on Purdue’s campus will help drive students forward in their persistent pursuit of bettering human health.”
The new Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building is proposed to house four floors featuring clinical simulation labs, collaboration spaces, large active-learning classrooms and modern research facilities. The building’s design will encourage nursing and pharmacy faculty and students to collaborate, conduct interdisciplinary research and develop impactful strategies that make a difference across public health, mental health, health equity and more. The building will have centrally scheduled classroom space that could serve the entire campus, including the two colleges.
Nearly two-thirds of all pharmacists in Indiana are Purdue graduates, and nearly two-thirds of Purdue School of Nursing graduates work in Indiana clinics, hospitals and communities. Through enhancing simulation opportunities and interprofessional education, the Nursing and Pharmacy Education Building will align with the university’s land-grant mission to continue to advance Purdue as a leader in shaping Indiana health and well-being.

"Ranked No. 1, Purdue’s 100% online hospitality and tourism management master’s is a hot commodity","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Sidelined by the pandemic and now bolstered by pent-up demand from folks who were stuck at home for years, the hospitality industry is back, with industry groups such as the American Hotel and Lodging Association predicting that 2023 will surpass pre-COVID-19 demand.
The association is predicting something else as well – personnel shortages, including for trained managers. That makes Purdue University’s top-ranked, 100% online Master of Science in hospitality and tourism management a hot commodity. Essentially an MBA for hospitality and tourism managers, the accessible degree program is taught by faculty from Purdue’s flagship West Lafayette campus and a battery of industry experts.
“You get everything you would expect from a high-quality business degree, focused on hospitality and tourism management,” said Jonathan Day, associate professor and graduate program director in Purdue’s White Lodging-J.W. Marriott, Jr. School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.
UniversityHQ rates Purdue’s program No. 1 for Best Online Master’s in Hospitality Management in 2023, ahead of San Diego State, New York University, Auburn and Central Florida in the top five.
The ratings are based on data from, among other things, government sites such as College Navigator, College Scorecard and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, along with nongovernmental sites like Payscale. UniversityHQ considers a variety of factors including acceptance, retention and graduation rates; graduating salaries; reputation in the industry; and expert opinion.
“I think it speaks to the reputation that we’ve developed over time as being a strong program,” said Ceridwyn King, professor and head of the White Lodging-J.W. Marriott, Jr. School. “Purdue was one of the first in the online space for a credible, high-production-quality online learning experience at the graduate level.”
Purdue’s online Master of Science in hospitality and tourism management is designed for experienced professionals who need to fit enhancing their careers around a job and other commitments. Students who go through the program are looking to distinguish themselves and develop professionally, whether that’s to pursue a new job or a promotion or just in general expand their skill set, King said.
The program’s reputation was a selling point for Morgan Mason, who graduated in August 2022 and now works on the strategic development team for Wyndham Hotels and Resorts. Working remotely managing properties for Marriott in the Washington, D.C., area when she enrolled in 2020, at the height of the pandemic, she also needed an online program with the flexibility to fit into a busy schedule. That included not only work and school, but also participating in the She Has a Deal pitch competition, which is designed to open pathways to hotel ownership and development for women. (Mason ended up winning the $50,000 grand prize in the competition’s early career track.)
“What I liked about Purdue’s program was that it really fit in with my schedule,” Mason said. “Each class was eight weeks at a time, so I was only focused on one course for that eight-week period, which was manageable. The other thing I appreciated was the flexibility my professors showed, how accommodating they were because they knew I was trying to get all my assignments done but I also had two other major things that were going on.”
The experiential, project-oriented curriculum is presented asynchronously but also features flexible opportunities to interact with the instructors and fellow students. The program includes hospitality industry-oriented courses in subjects such as hospitality and tourism leadership; accounting, finance and revenue management; business statistics and quantitative analysis; business law and personnel systems; risk and service management; hospitality and tourism marketing; and more. A capstone project addresses real-world challenges in the industry.
“I had mostly been in sales and revenue management at the point that I entered into the program,” Mason said. “For me, getting to take courses in marketing, corporate finance, the elements of service, human resources, hospitality law – these are all things that I hadn’t had much exposure to in my roles. It expanded my knowledge base within the industry.”
While the focus is on the business side of hospitality and tourism management, the hospitality and tourism master’s – much like an MBA – teaches executive business and management skills that are immediately applicable, translate to a variety of industries and service-oriented positions, and expand graduates’ career options.
“The emphasis is on elevating their analytical, critical thinking mindset as opposed to some graduate programs that are an introductory to the industry,” King said. “That’s not what this program is about. It’s going to set them up to pursue a range of professional opportunities and stand out from their peers.”

High-tech toolkit to analyze digital evidence made more efficient and budget-friendly for law enforcement agencies,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Local, state, federal and international law enforcement agencies that reconstruct and analyze digital evidence to solve crimes can use a high-tech toolkit from Purdue University that has been upgraded to be easier and more cost-effective to set up and maintain.
The new version of the Toolkit for Selective Analysis & Reconstruction of Files, called FileTSAR+, provides a mechanism to selectively reconstruct and analyze multiple data types, including documents, images, email and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) sessions for large-scale computer networks.
Kathryn Seigfried-Spellar, associate professor of computer and information technology at Purdue Polytechnic Institute, led the team that created the toolkit. She said feedback from law enforcement agencies prompted changes to improve it.
“We have reduced the requirements from end users so the toolkit is less resource intensive for agencies of all sizes,” Seigfried-Spellar said. “Law enforcement officers already work hard to prove probable cause in order to gain permission to access digital files. We want to remove any burdens in setting up the toolkit so they can spend more time working their cases.”
The team’s first step to improve the toolkit was removing the functionality to capture digital evidence.
“Law enforcement agencies have already captured the data they need; they just lacked a way to process and reconstruct files,” Seigfried-Spellar said. “Removing the capacity to capture the digital evidence has made FileTSAR+ much more resource efficient.”
The team’s second step was repackaging the toolkit from an open-source, virtual machine-based system with a 15-step process to a less complicated process that allows users to download and run files on a laptop computer in a single step.
“Now law enforcement agencies can download a single, 10-gigabit file and use the toolkit immediately,” Seigfried-Spellar said.
Seigfried-Spellar built the toolkit along with Marcus Rogers, John Springer and Baijian Yang, all professors of computer and information technology in the Purdue Polytechnic Institute. Rogers also is director of Purdue’s Cybersecurity & Forensics Lab. They received funding from the National Institute of Justice to develop the toolkit, which was beta tested by certified digital forensic examiners with the National White Collar Crime Center and the Tippecanoe County High Tech Crime Unit.
Sean Leshney, director of digital forensics investigations at the Tippecanoe County High Tech Crime Unit, said the FileTSAR+ development team did great work to expand the tool’s capabilities to the benefit of end users.
“FileTSAR+ reduces the time and effort examining data captured over networks,” Leshney said. “We look forward to the future improvements of FileTSAR+ by Purdue University to aid in the area of network forensics.”
Law enforcement agencies interested in gaining access to FileTSAR+ should submit information to an online form to initiate the process.

"Internet inventors Cerf and Kahn to join President Chiang for September Presidential Lecture Series event, marking Purdue Computer Science’s 60th anniversary","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, the tandem credited with founding the Internet in the early 1970s, will join Purdue University President Mung Chiang for a Presidential Lecture Series event in September, coinciding with the 60th anniversary celebration of Purdue’s historic launch of the nation’s first academic computer science department.
The discussion with Cerf and Kahn, who are commonly called the “Fathers of the Internet,” is planned for Thursday, Sept. 7. The time and location will be announced later. The Presidential Lecture event, which is free and open to the public, is titled “Origins of the Internet and its Subsequent Evolution” and comes a half-century since the pivotal period of Cerf and Kahn’s groundbreaking work.
“As Purdue continues the yearlong celebration of the nation’s first computer science department 60 years ago and launches new investments, such as 50 new faculty in computing departments, to attain the pinnacle of excellence, it is particularly exciting to bring to our campus the two pioneers of the Internet who paved the way for one of the planet-changing innovations of our Information Age,” Chiang said. “Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn are true American trailblazers, and their Presidential Lecture at Purdue coincides with their inventing the TCP/IP half a century ago. Their creativity and persistence define the very essence of pinnacle of excellence and impact.”
Cerf and Kahn led the design and implementation of what formed the basis of the Internet, beginning with their seminal research paper in the early 1970s. Titled “A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication,” the paper was subsequently published in the iEEE Transactions on Communications in May 1974 and outlined the resulting Internet architecture for the technological innovation that’s ubiquitous today.
In a mere six months in 1973, Cerf and Kahn crafted the common digital language that provides the pathways for interconnecting vast network devices. They developed the Transmission Control Protocol, which later split off the Internet Protocol, becoming TCP/IP, seen in the network settings of computers to this day. In geek speak, they formulated fundamental protocols for wireless and wired networking, specified TCP/IP to meet these requirements, prototyped TCP/IP and coordinated early TCP/IP implementations.
They first met when Kahn came to UCLA in 1969 to help test the nascent Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, known as ARPANET. Kahn and Cerf formed an effective working relationship to generate test data and predict and diagnose problems in the network. Later they began work on the Internet, completing their design in the fall of 1973. The effort spanned more than 10 years, and the birthday of the operational Internet is Jan. 1, 1983. In the ensuing decades, computer networks across the globe were able to communicate with each other using protocols developed by Kahn and Cerf.
Cerf received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Stanford University in 1965, then spent two years at IBM, where he contributed to QUIKTRAN, a FORTRAN based time-sharing system. Drawn to the field of computer science, he left IBM to study at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he earned his master’s degree and PhD in computer science in 1970 and 1972, respectively.
Kahn earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at the City College of New York in 1960 before earning his master’s degree in 1962 and PhD in 1964 in electrical engineering from Princeton University. His first job was with AT&T Bell Labs before he joined the electrical engineering department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor in 1964. Kahn took a leave of absence from MIT in 1966 to work at a local research and development firm, Bolt, Beranek and Newman (now known as Raytheon BBN), where he began developing his own ideas for computer networking.
For their global-changing achievements, Cerf and Kahn have collected countless awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the U.S., as well as the ACM A.M. Turing Award, the highest distinction in computer science; the U.S. National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the highest technology honor; the Japan Prize, that country’s most prestigious honor for science and technology in 2008; and many honorary doctoral degrees.
Sixty-years ago, Purdue celebrated the launch of its groundbreaking computer science program when it dedicated its new high-speed IBM 7090 digital computer. Today, Purdue’s computer science program is the largest and most selective on campus, with 2,405 undergraduate and 538 graduate students enrolled as of Fall 2022.
And just two weeks ago, Purdue unveiled its Purdue Computes initiative, which will provide vital strategic investments for faculty hires, artificial intelligence research and semiconductor facility upgrades, with the goal of becoming one of the top 10 computer science programs in the U.S. by the end of the decade.
Launched in 2014 by then-Purdue President Mitch Daniels and continued in 2023 by President Mung Chiang, the Presidential Lecture Series exposes Purdue students and the broader community to inspiring ideas, courageous leadership and models of civic engagement and civil discourse. The Presidential Lecture Series has had over 40 guests of many viewpoints and perspectives who have hosted some of the great intellectual, business and civic leaders of our time. As one of the world’s premier centers of scholarly leadership, Purdue is – appropriately and necessarily – a regular venue for great thinkers across a wide variety of disciplines.

Purdue@DC to amplify Boilermaker presence in nation’s capital,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University President Mung Chiang announced Friday (April 28) Purdue@DC, an initiative that will amplify the university’s presence in Washington, D.C.
Through the new initiative, Purdue brings to the capital unique strengths in national security, tech diplomacy, semiconductor talent and other policy research.
“As the most consequential public university in America, Purdue has a special responsibility to bring all that Boilermakers have to offer to the capital,” Chiang said. “Through Purdue@DC, we will both strengthen the impact of existing programs in D.C. and deploy new ones that bring many more faculty and students to national public service.”
Purdue@DC’s physical presence will be headquartered in a co-working space at 1301 K Street NW. The space will be the D.C. home to Purdue’s nationally recognized semiconductor and microelectronics program, the Purdue Applied Research Institute (PARI), the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, Purdue Policy Research Institute, and Purdue’s federal relations team.
In addition, to build a stronger talent pipeline from Purdue to the nation’s capital, the C-SPAN Boilers Go to D.C. program will grow in scale and in scope, connecting D.C.-based alumni, as well as government and agency partners, with current students and faculty, providing internship, networking and engagement opportunities. The program is designed to help students prepare for a successful career after graduation. All colleges, schools, departments, institutes and centers at Purdue West Lafayette will be able to propose activities in our nation’s capital.
On April 18, Purdue@DC convened leaders from industry, government and academia at the Russell Senate Office Building for “CHIPS for America: Execute for Success Summit.” Chiang led a keynote fireside chat with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and U.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana. Over 175 companies, government agencies and universities participated at the event. Association of American Universities President Barbara Snyder made a call at the Summit for industry and government leaders to support research, students and faculty in the STEM fields.
The next signature event by Purdue@DC will be in October. Further details on Purdue@DC can be found here and inquiries directed to dc@purdue.edu.","[{'summary_text': 'Purdue brings to the capital unique strengths in national security, tech diplomacy, semiconductor talent and other policy research . the C-SPAN Boilers Go to D.C. program is designed to help students prepare for a successful career after graduation .'}]"
Purdue Day of Giving thanks all donors for historic $110.8 million,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Boilermakers around the world celebrated the 10th Purdue Day of Giving, held Wednesday (April 26), by demonstrating their support to Purdue University’s campuses and programs — and raising a record $110.8 million in the process.
This year’s 24-hour online, social media-driven fundraising effort inspired 27,855 gifts, shattering last year’s results and bringing Purdue Day of Giving’s cumulative total since its launch in 2014 to $420.5 million. The new historic high followed last year’s record $68.2 million and 26,726 gifts. All gifts are donor directed to support the initiatives and programs they specify (see thank-you video).
“Excellence at scale relies on the support from many. Thank you all for your extraordinary support that made this Purdue Day of Giving a truly historic one, with the milestone results of $110.8 million that shattered our single-day fundraising record by a margin even larger than we ever anticipated,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “It is an honor to represent the Purdue University system and thank the generous alumni, students, families, colleagues and organizations across the globe. I was particularly privileged to have the ‘investiture run’ and host a ‘community cookout’ on such a meaningful day for our university.”
Purdue Day of Giving encompasses all of the university’s campuses — West Lafayette, Purdue Fort Wayne and Purdue Northwest — as well as Purdue Global.
Through 28 hourly challenges and six #IGave challenges, 81 academic and nonacademic programs competed for cash prizes. Gifts ranged from $10 to $20 million, supporting a range of programs and academic initiatives. Among the gifts made were:
Transformational gift from Thomas Howatt to support the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business.
$17 million from Jeannie and Jim Chaney to support scholarships in the College of Pharmacy.
$10 million from William and Barbara Rakosnik in support of the School of Mechanical Engineering, the Department of Psychological Sciences and University Residences.
$1.2 million from Walter Gautschi, in memory of Erika Gautschi, for PhD student support in computational mathematics.
$250,000 from Willard Agri-Service to fund the renovation of the sixth-floor conference room in the Agricultural Economics Department.
$50,000 from Michelle Tucker and Darin Melnyk to support a scholarship endowment in the Brian Lamb School of Communication.
Major gift from Jennifer Crandall to support the Emerging Leaders Scholars program, a universitywide diversity initiative.
$10 from Ata Tamer, president of the Turkish Student Association, to support the organization.
Also, thanks to a leadership-level gift from Drew and Brittany Brees, 356 donors at three different giving levels to the new Tiller Tunnel initiative had their donation matched and will be publicly recognized on the wall at the entrance to this future enhancement of Ross-Ade Stadium.
“Once again, Boilermakers have shown their Purdue pride by setting another record for dollars raised through a higher education day of giving,” said Matt Folk, president and CEO of the Purdue for Life Foundation and vice president of university advancement and alumni engagement for Purdue University. “The accomplishments of Purdue’s students, faculty and staff are only possible through the loyal support of our alumni, friends, fans and community members. Thank you to everyone who participated in Purdue Day of Giving, whether it was by making a gift or sharing your Purdue pride with others. Because of your generosity, Purdue is positioned to take its next giant leap.”
In addition to a day of generosity, it was also a day of celebrations in West Lafayette. Students, faculty and staff enjoyed an evening event that featured “Giant Adventures” — a 20-foot-high stunt jump, zorb wars and an inflatable corn maze — as well as lawn games, a 360-degree photo booth, food trucks and more.
Earlier in the day, a campuswide relay run featured student organizations and Purdue celebrities, including Purdue Pete, the Boilermaker Special and President Chiang, who ran the last leg of the relay along with students, faculty and staff.

"Purdue Global to celebrate more than 1,400 graduates at May commencements","summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue Global, Purdue’s online university for working adults, will host commencement ceremonies on Purdue University’s campus on Saturday, May 6, for more than 1,400 graduates.
In-person ceremonies are scheduled for 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. ET at Purdue’s Elliott Hall of Music in West Lafayette. A special Boilermaker Block Party will be held outside Hovde Hall between the two ceremonies, and a virtual ceremony follows at 7 p.m. ET.
The graduates reside in 49 states – including 290 Indiana residents – as well as the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, China, Guatemala, South Africa and the United Kingdom. There are 251 graduates affiliated with the military. Fifty-three systemwide Purdue University employees are among those earning a Purdue Global degree or certificate via the Purdue Global education benefit.
Tickets are not required for admission to Elliott Hall, and all attendees will have any bags checked at the door prior to entry.
Chancellor Frank Dooley will address the 1,414 graduates — 1,004 registered to attend in person and 410 virtually — and nearly 8,500 guests and faculty and staff members. Purdue University President Mung Chiang will also address the graduates.
“Many of our graduates have a comeback story to share. I’m glad Purdue Global could be a part of the success associated with it,” Dooley said. “Balancing school, work and life is not an easy task. Students leaned on family, friends, children and co-workers for encouragement and support throughout their journey.”
Lauren Castrinos Bradford, who earned her Master of Arts in psychology with a concentration in applied behavior analysis (ABA) from Purdue Global in November 2020, will provide the keynote address. Bradford is from Anderson, South Carolina, and started her career in ABA after receiving her bachelor’s degree. In 2014 her son Dexter was born. Her background in ABA helped her realize Dexter would eventually be diagnosed with autism. Bradford stayed home with her two sons until they were old enough to attend preschool, at which time she enrolled in Purdue Global to further her education in ABA. During this time, Dexter was officially diagnosed with autism. Experiencing firsthand the difference ABA could make for her family, she became further committed to supporting other families in their own journeys. She was inducted as a member of the Psi Chi International Honor Society in Psychology. Upon completion of the required hours, she passed the board exam on her first attempt to be a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. Bradford now works from home for Total Care ABA Therapy, servicing Georgia families via telehealth.
On May 2 Chris Findley will continue Purdue Global’s tradition of giving the “Last Lecture” to graduates. Findley is a faculty member teaching criminal justice and forensic psychology courses. Faculty are nominated by students and then selected for the “Last Lecture” as a testimony of their impact on students.
Purdue Global will host a Black and Gold Celebration for all in-person graduates from 5-6:30 p.m. Friday, May 5, at Ross-Ade Stadium’s Shively Club. Afterward, Purdue for Life Foundation will celebrate the latest Purdue Global active-duty and veteran graduates with a Military Appreciation Dinner in the Purdue Memorial Union. Randy Adams, an active-duty member of the U.S. Army who will receive his bachelor’s degree during the commencement ceremonies, will provide the dinner’s keynote address. Adams suffered extensive injuries and trauma following an assault while on leave.
More information, including how to watch commencement ceremonies online, can be found at the Commencement Showroom.
Purdue Global recently launched a new brand platform and marketing campaign called “This Is My Comeback” that highlights the fact there are nearly 40 million Americans who have earned college credits but have not completed a degree. Purdue Global has many partnerships with Fortune 500 companies or through partners like Guild to become one of the leading options for employee education benefits.
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey. Purdue Global is a nonprofit, public university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and backed by Purdue University. For more information, visit https://stories.purdue.edu/purdue-global.

Changing lives through inventions: Purdue jumps to the top 5 of global leaders in US patents received,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Exciting and dynamic inventions discovered and developed by Purdue University researchers are improving people’s lives around the world.
A system that processes agricultural field images for remote phenotype measurements. A 3D printer that continuously prints structures as small as 100 nanometers. A process that produces butylene, propylene and ethylene from natural gas liquids in shale gas. These are just a few influential Purdue innovations that were patented in 2022, further cementing Purdue’s place as a global leader among its peers in protecting intellectual property.
In 2022, Purdue Research Foundation received an impressive 192 patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), placing it fifth internationally. The top-five breakthrough comes on the heels of Purdue’s No. 6 ranking in both 2020 and 2021, when it received 175 and 169 patents, respectively. The newest ranking was released Wednesday (April 26).
The reporting includes multiple campuses in the same system as one (e.g., the University of California system, with 10 campuses, and the University of Texas system, with eight campuses), and international universities (e.g., King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia). In terms of single American university campuses, the top 5 are Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Purdue University, Stanford University, Harvard University, and California Institute of Technology.
The information was published in a report from the National Academy of Inventors.
“In achieving our highest annual ranking of U.S. patents so far, Purdue, along with MIT, stand out as single American campuses without medical schools that count among the most active in inventions,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “Boilermaker inventors are colleagues and students who translate their knowledge creation through a foundation for direct impact to society. Half of the equation in the recently launched Purdue Innovates is to provide the best support for them to disclose inventions, apply for and receive patents, and license and deploy these patented inventions.”
The Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization manages the technology transfer process to vet, protect and license innovations developed by university researchers, including filing patent applications. Its technology portfolio covers innovations in subject areas including agriculture, biotechnology, chemistry and chemical analysis, computer technology, engineering, food and nutrition, green technology, micro- and nanotechnologies, and more.
Brian Edelman, president of Purdue Research Foundation said, “Purdue Research Foundation provides resources to support faculty, staff and student researchers across all academic disciplines and campuses who want to commercialize their inventions. These commercialization resources bring this leading-edge and most modern work to the public, where it can strengthen quality of life and economic and workforce development.”
Brooke Beier, senior vice president of Purdue Innovates said, “We wanted to create an ecosystem that embraced all Boilermakers by supporting both Purdue-owned intellectual property and startups that have their own intellectual property but have some other connection to Purdue, such as an alum. Solidifying the university core while engaging and leveraging the Boilermaker network is key to enhancing Purdue’s ability to become the preeminent university in commercialization and startup success.”
Among the 2022 patents were:
“Augmented reality platform for collaborative classrooms” by Karthik Ramani, the Donald W. Feddersen Distinguished Professor in Mechanical Engineering and professor of electrical and computer engineering, College of Engineering.
“Collagen compositions and methods of use” by Sherry L. Harbin, professor, College of Engineering and College of Veterinary Medicine.
“Furniture and methods of storage” by Tong Jin “TJ” Kim, professor, College of Liberal Arts.

Pharmacy alumna and husband give additional $17 million to support Purdue College of Pharmacy,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
JeanAnne “Jeannie” and Jim Chaney, the Purdue University College of Pharmacy’s most generous donors, have made an additional $17 million commitment in support of pharmacy scholarships.
The Chaneys, who have supported a wide range of strategic opportunities at Purdue, are among the most prolific benefactors in university history. Including this estate gift, they have committed more than $44 million over 45 years.
“With this latest gift, the Chaneys have shown yet again how generous they are and how deep their love for Purdue runs,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “Their commitment to the university, its strategic vision and its students is essentially unmatched, and their impact will be felt for many generations to come.”
The most recent contribution will be distributed through the Chaney Family Scholarship Endowment. Scholarships established by the Chaneys include the JeanAnne D. & James B. Chaney Scholarship in Pharmacy, the JeanAnne Darr and James B. Chaney Education and Development Fund, the Jim and JeanAnne Chaney Pharmacy Student Support Endowment, and the James Russel Maier Memorial Scholarship.
“Scholarships have always been a major component of our giving because college debt is such a big concern for students,” the Chaneys said. “Purdue continues to prioritize affordability and accessibility, and we are in full support of that initiative. We strongly believe it is possible for Purdue Pharmacy, which is currently ranked No. 4 nationally, to remain among the top pharmacy programs in the country while the university still offers one of the most affordable educations around.”
The Chaneys have a long history of giving to Purdue and the College of Pharmacy.
Among numerous other contributions, they previously made the lead gift for the Chaney-Hale Hall of Science and, in 2022, funded the first-ever termed deanship at the university with a $6 million pledge. That gift established the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean of Pharmacy for five years and the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean’s Excellence Fund Endowment for Pharmacy.
The couple was recognized for their philanthropy with the Purdue President’s Council Crystal Boilermaker Special and the college’s Friends of Pharmacy award. The Chaneys also are recipients of the President’s Council Pinnacle Award, the highest recognition for philanthropic contributions to Purdue.
“Simply put, the College of Pharmacy has been transformed by the passion and generosity of the Chaneys,” said Eric Barker, the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean of the College of Pharmacy. “In both the near and long term, their wide-ranging commitment will provide life-changing support for our students and enhance almost every aspect of our college, from the students and faculty we recruit to the facilities we use.”
Jeannie Chaney (pharmacy ‘61) served as a pharmacist in Ohio for nearly 50 years before retiring in 2011. She has served as chair of President’s Council and as a member of the steering committee of Pharmacy Women for Purdue and the Pharmacy Alumni Board. Jim Chaney is president of the Cleveland Syrup Corp., which provides sweeteners to food manufacturing companies. He earned his bachelor’s degree in economics from Denison University.
“It seems like every time Purdue seeks support for its next giant leap, the Chaneys are willing to step up and do whatever it takes,” said Matt Folk, president and CEO of the Purdue for Life Foundation and vice president for university advancement and alumni engagement at Purdue. “They are always in lockstep with the university, this time making one of the largest commitments toward affordability in Purdue history. I know the Chaneys love contributing to Purdue Day of Giving, as well, and this gift really helped us move the needle.”

Purdue University receives $10 million commitment from alumni William and Barbara Rakosnik,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Alumni William (mechanical engineering ’69, MS industrial administration ’70) and Barbara (health and human sciences ’70) Rakosnik have committed more than $10 million to Purdue University in support of the School of Mechanical Engineering, the Department of Psychological Sciences and University Residences. The commitment will support graduate students and necessary services and programs in these areas.
The commitment includes $125,000 to establish endowments and a $10 million trust fund that will provide continued support.
“This generous gift from the Rakosniks is very important because it touches on several areas and focuses on students and their everyday experiences,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “Anybody who has been on a college campus knows that it’s the students, including graduate students, who bring a university to life. The impact of this gift will be felt by many of our students for decades to come.”
The initial pledge will be distributed as follows:
$50,000 to establish the William H. and Barbara L. Rakosnik Graduate Student Support Fund in Mechanical Engineering
$50,000 to establish the William H. and Barbara L. Rakosnik Graduate Student Support Fund in Psychology
$25,000 to establish the Bill and Barbara Rakosnik Legacy Experience Fund in University Residences
Regular trust income and eventual trust distribution will proceed along similar lines:
40% to the support fund in mechanical engineering
40% to the support fund in psychology
20% to the Legacy Experience Fund
Both graduate school support funds will provide recipients primarily with scholarship, fellowship and assistantship support; research funding and expenses for conferences; and other experiential learning opportunities. The purpose of the Legacy Experience Fund is to allow flexibility to support areas of strategic importance as determined by the director of University Residences.
“Outstanding faculty and a world-class education will always draw students to Purdue, but it’s the amazing young people you interact with that make life at the university so exceptional,” William Rakosnik said. “What we’re talking about is the undergraduate and graduate students you work with and learn from on a daily basis. All of this contributes to the development of a well-rounded student. We want to make sure this tradition continues — and we hope other alumni look back at their time on campus, remember how formative those years were and provide their own support.”
Longtime university benefactors, the Rakosniks are members of the Student Life Advisory Council, the Griffin Society, President’s Council and the Purdue Alumni Association. Their past contributions include support for academic scholarships, Purdue Musical Organizations, Purdue Bands & Orchestras, and Student Life.
The Rakosniks are now retired. William Rakosnik worked for more than 30 years in production control and distribution management at IBM. Barbara Rakosnik worked in architecture and later started her own embroidery business, Periwinkle Promises. They remain active as volunteers in their community.
“Bill and I really enjoyed living the whole campus experience,” Barbara Rakosnik said. “We were both resident assistants who were active in student organizations, and I worked on the yearbook. After a very brief encounter on campus, a few phone calls and four years of dating, we were married at the University Lutheran Church, right on campus. So, to say we have fond memories doesn’t even begin to cover it. When we give back, we have the whole student in mind. We feel strongly that every Purdue student deserves the opportunity to grow and blossom.”
Matt Folk, president and CEO of the Purdue for Life Foundation and vice president for university advancement and alumni engagement at Purdue, said, “This gift from the Rakosniks really sets the tone in a very Purdue way — quietly, behind the scenes, they’re making a lasting difference. And they keep giving back to the school they love, with purpose and the utmost generosity.”

Purdue police warn of scam targeting parents and family members of students,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University police are warning about a phone scam targeting the parents and family members of current students.
Police on Wednesday (April 26) received multiple calls from families reporting they had received telephone calls from someone purporting to be with the Purdue University Police Department and requesting money for bail. The scammer reportedly requested banking information and stated their child or sibling had been arrested and needed bail money, adding that the parent or family member could not speak with the student until money was transferred.
This type of scam is referred to as vishing, which is the practice of making fraudulent phone calls or leaving messages that appear to be from legitimate sources. Criminals will use fear or intimidation tactics to have you reveal personal information, typically for monetary gain.
PUPD stresses it will never request payment of any kind over the phone.
Purdue Information Technology provides the following tips if you receive suspicious calls or voicemails:
· Ask for the caller’s name or employee number and call the organization back using the telephone number listed on billing statements or other official sources, not the number provided by the caller or caller ID. Vishing attacks often use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), which allows caller identification to be easily spoofed.
· Think once, twice and maybe three times about providing personal or financial information over the phone, especially if you did not initiate the call.

"Uncovering a star’s demise: Supermassive black hole tears apart a giant star in a display brighter, more energetic and longer lasting than any observed before","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A distant star, dying a fiery and dramatic death, torn apart by a supermassive black hole in a forgotten corner of the sky. One of the most luminous, energetic, long-lasting transient objects didn’t blaze through the night sky inspiring legends and launching civilizations. Instead, astronomers, acting as celestial supersleuths, uncovered evidence of the star’s death throes where it had hidden undetected for years in a mass of computer-gathered telescope data.
“It’s absurd. If you take a typical supernova and multiply it a thousand times, we’re still not at how bright this is – and supernovas are among the most luminous objects in the sky,” said Danny Milisavljevic, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy in Purdue University’s College of Science. “This is the most energetic phenomenon I have ever encountered.”
In astronomy, things that are the most luminous are often the most energetic. Milisavljevic, an expert on stellar life cycles – especially star death – noted that the data points to an extremely anomalous observation.
The object, like all those observed, was assigned a random name when it was discovered. Its name is ZTF20abrbeie, or, as astronomers affectionately call it, “Scary Barbie.” Barbie for its alphanumeric designation and “scary” because, Milisavljevic said, “It’s so much of an outlier; its characteristics are terrifying!”
The object is what is known as a transient – something observed in the sky that either appears and then disappears or changes in some dramatic way over the course of hours or days rather than centuries or millennia. In a new paper accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, Milisavljevic, his graduate student Bhagya Subrayan, and their team analyzed the data to conclude that the bright, long-lived transient is a black hole in the process of consuming a star. Subrayan’s research focuses on big data analysis of sky survey data.
“We think a very supermassive black hole pulled in a star and ripped it apart,” Subrayan said. “The forces around a black hole, called tidal disruption, pull other objects apart in a process called ‘spaghettification.’ We think that’s what happened, but on extreme time scales: The most massive of black holes ripping apart a massive star. The duration is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before, and it produced the most luminous transient in the universe.”
If Scary Barbie is so bright and so notable, how did it just now come to light, even though datasets indicate the first observations occurred in 2020?
It hid in plain sight. While it’s bright, it is also extremely far away and in a somewhat neglected corner of the sky. The anomaly was discovered using Milisavljevic’s lab’s AI engine. The Recommender Engine For Intelligent Transient Tracking (REFITT) combs through observations from a number of telescopes around the world, including those made by the Zwicky Transient Facility using the Palomar Observatory in California.
“REFITT does big data analysis,” Milisavljevic said. “It combs through millions of alerts and figures out what interesting things we might want to look at closer. This is a great example. Computers are really good at finding things when we can tell them precisely what to look for. But things like this, anomalous objects, the computer often doesn’t even know to look for. It doesn’t even have a template. This is so different from anything else we’ve ever seen that we hadn’t even gotten around to trying to classify it. It’s been hanging out in the public data for years.”
Once the team and REFITT had identified Scary Barbie as an intriguing opportunity for research, they used data from other telescopes, including the Lick Observatory in California and the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Spectrographic analysis from those telescopes helped the team put a name to the odd phenomenon the data reported.
Scary Barbie is not just orders of magnitude brighter and more energetic than any transient scientists have recorded before, but it is also lasting much longer than usual transients do. Most transients last weeks or months, but this one has lasted for more than 800 days – over two years – and latest available data show that it may be visible for years to come.
The actual event itself – the spaghettification of this massive star – may be of much shorter duration, but because the transient is so far away the law of relativity slows down the light as it travels to human eyes, making it seem to last nearly twice as long.
“There are few things in the universe that can be so powerful, reactions that can be this long-lived,” Milisavljevic said. “Discoveries like this really open our eyes to the fact that we are still uncovering mysteries and exploring wonders in the universe – things no one has ever seen before.”
This research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation.

Applications open for Purdue’s new fully online Master of Science in International Agribusiness,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University is taking applications for its new fully online Professional Master of Science in International Agribusiness aimed at agribusiness professionals worldwide. The application deadline is July 1 for the inaugural cohort beginning in August.
The new degree is for learners wanting to enhance their skills in data analytics, quantitative data analysis and data-based decision-making. This knowledge is applicable whether they work in industry or government, management or marketing, and in a range of areas from commercial agriculture to food product development and production, and from natural resources management to managing supply chains. The degree teaches a skill set applicable to working in the fast-paced global economy as well as the dynamic international agribusiness and food industry.
While the 100% online option is new, the mature, rigorous curriculum has been taught and refined for a decade by faculty in Purdue’s Department of Agricultural Economics who excel at teaching, research and engagement covering all aspects of their field. Each of the instructors also has multiple years of experience teaching in online and hybrid modes.
In addition to the required courses, students choose one of two specialized online graduate certificates – in Spatial Data Science or in Biotechnology Quality and Regulatory Compliance, the latter from Purdue’s top-ranked (U.S. News & World Report) Agricultural and Biological Engineering Department. The graduate certificate satisfies 12 credits of the 36 credits needed to earn the full master’s degree in international agribusiness. The two graduate certificates also can be taken separately from the master’s program.
Learners should be able to complete the degree in 18-24 months, said Nicole Widmar, professor and associate head of agricultural economics at Purdue and graduate program chair. Since the coursework is online and asynchronous, students can complete it where and when it works best for them. That makes Purdue’s program readily accessible for working professionals or for new graduates who are ready to start work but also want to earn an advanced degree.
Some previous knowledge of quantitative methods is helpful, Widmar said, but individuals do not need to have a bachelor’s in agricultural economics to enroll in the master’s program. Core courses are:
Applied Quantitative Methods for Decision Making.
Economics for Food and Agribusiness Managers.
Communication and Issues Engagement for Agricultural Professionals.
Problem Solving and Project Management for Decision Makers.
Quantitative Managerial Decision Making.
The Macroeconomic Trade and Policy Environment of the Food System.
Strategic Food and Agribusiness Management.
In addition, the core requirements include a capstone course with an analytic paper, which can be either academic in nature or work related, in lieu of a thesis.

Purdue researchers build transparent conductors without expensive rare-earth indium,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University researchers have created transparent organic conductors from patent-pending polymers that achieve the same results and properties as traditional conductors made from rare-earth minerals but are less expensive and can be created from more plentiful reserves.
Transparent conductors are critical components in light-emitting diodes, touch screens, solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is used in more than 95% of global transparent conductors. It conducts electric current through a device, which is disrupted when a person swipes or taps a touch screen.
Jianguo Mei, the Richard and Judith Wien Associate Professor of Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry, said touch screens are made of several layers, including a top layer of glass or plastic, a conductive layer beneath it, and a circuit board that reads the signals sent by the conductive layer.
“When a user touches the screen, their finger creates a disruption in the electrical field generated by the conductive layer,” Mei said. “This disruption is detected by the circuit board, which can then determine the location of the touch and interpret it as a command, such as opening an app or typing a message.”
Because ITO is transparent as a thin film, users can view images, text and video through it.
Mei said traditional transparent conductors have drawbacks.
“Indium tin oxide films are mechanically fragile, which makes them undesirable in roll-to-roll manufacturing,” Mei said. “Also, indium is a rare-earth mineral with scarce reserves; the U.S. Geological Survey said the U.S. was 100% reliant on indium imports in 2021. Because demand for ITO films is increasing, the price of indium has soared. This has led to the search for alternatives, including metal mesh, graphene and earth-abundant metal oxides and organic conductors.”
Mei and his research team have created a patent-pending polymer from carbon-based materials that have a lower manufacturing cost and are easier to manufacture into thin films than indium through solution-coating processing. He said performance of the new thin-film transparent conductors also rivals that of conductors made with indium tin oxide.
“The polymer ink is shelf-stable for months under ambient conditions, compared to commercially available PEDOT:PSS,” Mei said. “Our new transparent organic conductors exhibit low sheet resistance and high transmittance compared to any other solution processable transparent conductors. Also, it exhibits excellent durability under accelerated weathering tests.”
Mei and his team’s research was published in the February 2023 issue of the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Chemical Society. He said the next steps to advance the innovation are to continually improve the figure of merit of their organic conductor and develop ink formation for large-scale processing.
Mei disclosed the polymer innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has filed for a patent application from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in further developing the technology for the marketplace should contact Will Buchanan, assistant director of business development – physical sciences, wdbuchanan@prf.org, about 2023-MEI-69956.

Purdue Global Law School’s rural law course helps address legal deserts,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Dr. Amber Fort, a critical care physician who practices in North Dakota and North Carolina, is also a student at Purdue Global Law School with a passion for advocating for those who can’t advocate for themselves — a situation Fort says is particularly common in rural areas.
“It’s been frustrating me for a long time,” Fort said. “I thought that the best way to sit at the table with the people who make the rules would be to get the credentials myself.”

Holly Carter sees it, too. She is a Purdue Global Law School alumna aiming to address the scarcity of legal professionals in her rural northern California community. Carter and Fort are using what they learned in a Rural Law Practice course (CL817) offered by Purdue Global Law School. Both say the information provided in the course is helping them understand the needs of their communities, especially in systems that the clients need assistance navigating. It also helps them maintain relationships with local communities.
“The work that I do right now really supports economic and ecological health; and I feel that, in rural areas especially, we need to have the connection to land and small communities and all the pros and cons that that brings,” Carter said.
The course, which begins another session May 1 and is open for registration, is designed to provide students with a foundation of knowledge to understand issues affecting rural law practice, including differences in demographics and socioeconomic status that affect potential clients.
Course topics include foundational concepts that impact rural areas such as agricultural law; farm succession planning and land use; barriers to accessing and providing legal services in rural areas; and skills practice for effectively providing legal services to rural clients.
The rural law course is three credit hours, has no prerequisites and is open to all students. Hannah Catt, who is teaching the course, says this class is important because it builds on Purdue University’s land-grant mission — that agriculture and rural communities are fundamental to the institution’s past, present and future. Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults.
“I hope to have students in the course from all backgrounds — those who grew up in rural towns and want to serve them with their legal education, and those who’ve never set foot on a farm but want to gain an understanding of the unique needs of rural clients,” Catt said. “Really, it comes down to exposure and helping students see legal practice from a new perspective — one that is not touched on by most JD programs.”
Fort and Carter said the lessons learned during this course are invaluable in preparing law students to understand the lives and needs of those in less-populated areas.
“It was an interesting look at national regulations, state regulations in different areas,” Carter said. “It touched on so many different areas, and then highlighted how practice might be different for rural attorneys. It felt very pertinent to what I’m doing. I appreciate that Professor Catt brought those things up in a way that was always interesting, was neutral and yet highlighted the importance of federal and state environmental and labor law impacts on rural communities, now and into the future.”
The differences in rural law settings are what stood out the most for Fort.
“I learned that rural law, much like rural medicine, is an entirely different situation from city law or corporate law, international law or any other kind of branch of law,” Fort said. “The things that people need in rural communities are different from what most people in cities need, and access to services is different.”
According to the American Bar Association, 40% of rural counties and county-equivalents average fewer than 1 lawyer per 1,000 residents — something Catt said is important for Purdue Global Law School to address. (Nationwide, the average is roughly 1 lawyer per 250 residents.)
“Rural communities are so integral to every state in different ways — culturally, economically, even politically,” Catt said. “As attorneys, we are trained to think critically and creatively to solve problems, so we should apply those skills to the rural attorney shortage as well.”
Carter and Fort found that they have been able to immediately apply the knowledge gained from Catt’s course, along with other law courses at Purdue Global.
“I’ve worked mostly with state agencies in California,” Carter said. “While taking this course, looking at the issues in legal deserts with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Land Management, along with things like the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act and how they affect farms, have benefited me in my work.”
Communities, rural law and rural medicine often are interconnected in ways that can’t be seen, Fort said.
“I hope to find a way to operationalize that expertise acquired in rural areas,” Fort said. “Professor Catt was really good at connecting various aspects of the law — what happens with food and agriculture law and things like that — that you would think wouldn’t have very much impact in a world such as mine, but it really does.”

Insignum AgTech and Beck’s collaborate to help corn ‘talk’,"summarize:ATLANTA, Ind. —
Insignum AgTech® and Beck’s have signed an agreement to test Insignum’s innovative corn traits in Beck’s elite varieties. The companies will collaborate to cross the trait into proprietary Beck’s genetics for field-testing in 2023 to evaluate commercial viability of the traits.
Insignum AgTech develops plant genetic traits that enable plants to “talk” and signal to farmers when specific plant stresses begin.
“With this trait, a corn plant generates purple pigment, indicating that a fungal infection has started but is not yet apparent. Additional traits will utilize other natural pigments, such as red or blue, that give an early indication of yield-limiting factors such as insect pests or fertility loss,” said Insignum Ag Tech CEO Kyle Mohler, a Purdue University alumnus. “Farmers will gain the ability to sustainably and precisely treat when and where needed, ultimately increasing yields without arbitrarily increasing costly inputs.”
As Insignum AgTech transitions from research to a commercial development phase, Mohler is pleased to collaborate with Beck’s, the largest family-owned retail seed company and the third-largest seed brand in the U.S.
“Beck’s values technology that helps farmers succeed,” said Tom Koch, research manager at Beck’s. “Insignum’s genetic traits are well aligned with that mission. Farmers can see what their plants need and then respond to improve crop health and yields. We were encouraged by Insignum’s results we saw in field trials last year, and we’re hopeful about this collaboration.”
Initial results of the trials will be available to select stakeholders at Insignum’s Field Demonstration Days in central Indiana in the fall.
In January 2022, Insignum AgTech received a $100,000 investment from the Purdue Ag-Celerator, an agriculture innovation fund. Ag-Celerator provides critical startup support for Purdue innovators who bring Purdue-patented intellectual property or Purdue “know-how” technologies to market. It is operated by the Purdue Foundry, with assistance from the Purdue College of Agriculture, the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization and the agricultural industry.
Mohler earned his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Purdue in 2007. He was a postdoctoral researcher at the university from 2015-18 before he founded Insignum AgTech in 2019.
Insignum AgTech creates biotechnology that enables plants to use their pigments to warn growers about plant stresses, such as disease, insect pests or low fertility. For more information, see insignum.ag.

Purdue Ventures invests in antibody-based cancer therapeutics company,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue Ventures, which manages three funds to support Purdue University-connected startups, has invested $250,000 in TRIO Pharmaceuticals Inc., a cancer immunotherapeutics startup founded by a Purdue University biophysics and structural biology alumnus. The company’s antibody-based therapeutics strengthens the body’s defense, the immune system, to eradicate cancer.
Purdue Ventures’ investment is part of a larger $2.2 million series seed-funding round that includes investments from investor groups in the U.S. and Japan: NuFund Venture Group, SeedFolio, Friedman BioVentures, Tech Coast Angels, Newsight Tech Angels and others.
Shiva Bhowmik, TRIO’s founder and chief operating officer, said traditional approaches to developing anticancer drugs focus on eliminating cancer cells and activating the body’s immune system.
“These approaches don’t lead to the full enhancement of the body’s immunity to fight cancer because there is another bad actor involved: immunosuppressive cells,” he said. “These cells reduce the immune system’s ability to fight infections and diseases like cancer. TRIO Pharmaceuticals is the only company that has figured out how to selectively eliminate this bad actor.
“But if you eliminate just immunosuppressive cells, there isn’t a very strong enhancement of antitumor activity. So, the crux of what TRIO Pharmaceuticals does is to enhance antitumor immunity with a mix of directly eliminating both cancer cells and immunosuppressive cells.”
Bhowmik said Purdue Ventures’ investment and the funding round will allow TRIO to advance its technology and find the best drug candidates to further develop.
“This milestone is very critical for us,” he said. “Once we achieve it, it opens us up for further collaborations with large pharmaceutical companies and the possibility to raise future rounds of funding.”
TRIO has significant ties to Purdue.
“I earned my PhD in biophysics and structural biology from Purdue,” Bhowmik said. “During my tenure, Wayne Hockmeyer gave a talk as a distinguished alumnus of the Department of Biological Sciences. He had founded MedImmune, one of the world’s most renowned biotechnology companies that was eventually acquired by AstraZeneca.
“Wayne’s journey inspired me. He served his country as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army; he earned his doctorate and founded MedImmune. I was always very inclined to be an entrepreneur, and Wayne’s story inspired me to become an entrepreneur. Coincidentally, the structural biology building was dedicated to Wayne. I’m excited to maintain TRIO’s connections with Purdue through this investment from Purdue Ventures.”
Riley Gibb, associate director of Purdue Ventures, said TRIO Pharmaceuticals is a strong addition to the investment portfolio.
“TRIO is doing groundbreaking work in cancer therapeutics, which captured the interest of the investment committee,” he said. “The company has a unique perspective to address a worldwide problem. That and their connections with Purdue University make them a company we are proud to support and to follow their growth.”
With almost $20 million under current management, Purdue Ventures manages multiple pools of capital in collaboration with the university ecosystem and local corporations, enabling Purdue startups to improve the world.
TRIO Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a cancer immunotherapeutics company pioneering dual-action drugs to generate immunogenic tumors. TRIO’s innovative antibody drugs directly stop tumor growth and selectively stop immunosuppression in the tumor without targeting the current immune checkpoint pathways. TRIO is developing a proprietary platform of dual-action tumor immunity-enhancing drugs aimed at treating cancers of high unmet medical needs by targeting specific antigens on the cancer cells and immunosuppressor cells. TRIO has an experienced team that has developed first-in-class FDA-approved drugs.

Building on world-renowned strength in innovation by its faculty, staff, students and alumni, the Purdue Research Foundation and Purdue University have formed Purdue Innovates, a comprehensive system to streamline access and strengthen support to both (a) technology commercialization resources, such as intellectual property licensing and protection, and (b) startup support resources, including programs and funds to launch, scale and invest in Purdue-connected startups in one cohesive structure.
In recent years, Purdue has consistently ranked among the world leaders in bringing innovation to the marketplace. As one of the nation’s most innovative universities and the only university ranked among the world’ top 50 most innovative companies or nonprofits, Purdue never stops in the persistent pursuit of the next giant leap. From world-class research that is foundational to drugs that receive FDA approval to Purdue-connected startups changing the world, Boilermakers think big and push the boundaries of innovation. That excellence at scale is why Purdue is ranked 5th in the world for the number of issued U.S. utility patents and the only university from the state of Indiana to be ranked among the top 50 patent-receivers, and has produced some of the most visible startups from the Midwest. Purdue innovates.
“Purdue Innovates streamlines and strengthens the ecosystem for Boilermaker innovators in two ways,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “One is the generation and licensing of intellectual properties such as patents, where we have continued to be among the nation’s best. The other is the creation of startup companies by our students, faculty and alumni, where we are rolling out new strategies and new funds, broadening outreach to alumni across the country, and simplifying an impactful support system for Boilermaker entrepreneurs. Purdue Innovates will elevate excellence at scale for both inventors and entrepreneurs.”
With multiple colleges ranked among top 5 in the U.S. and the No. 1 undergrad STEM enrollment among America’s leading research universities, Purdue has long been the home for legendary inventors like Dr. Leslie Geddes and serial entrepreneurs like Dr. Philip Low.
“We wanted to create an ecosystem that embraced all Boilermakers by supporting both Purdue-owned intellectual property and startups that have their own intellectual property but have some other connection to Purdue, such as an alum,” said Brooke Beier, senior vice president of Purdue Innovates. “Solidifying the university core while engaging and leveraging the Boilermaker network is key to enhancing Purdue’s ability to become the preeminent university in commercialization and startup success.”
The Purdue Innovates network houses:
Office of Technology Commercialization, where Purdue innovators disclose new ideas for evaluation for intellectual property protection and commercialization via licensing to industry and startups.
Incubator, which consists of resources to 1) assist early-stage, Purdue-connected startups via programming and funding opportunities; and 2) de-risk Purdue innovations to increase the technology readiness level for licensing opportunities to industry and startups.
Startup Foundry, which helps with funding, programs and services focused on getting investible Purdue-connected startups ready to raise first-round funding. The Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship is now part of the Startup Foundry.
Purdue Ventures, which makes early-stage investments in Purdue-connected startups and gives guidance on raising capital to get startups late-stage funding and positioning them for an IPO or acquisition.
The strength of Purdue’s existing commercialization and entrepreneurship efforts will continue and collaborate with the above units. These include:

I-Corps, where Purdue is the Midwest hub’s co-lead
Entrepreneurship certificate and courses
Digital Innovation in Agriculture Systems Lab (DIAL)
John Martinson Entrepreneurial Center (JMEC)
Student organizations such as Anvil

Key partnership programs like Silicon Valley Boilermaker Innovation Group (SVBig), High Alpha with DIAL, and others remain an integral part of the Purdue Innovates startup ecosystem, where they help advance and fund high-value startups.
By establishing this front door to the commercialization and startup creation ecosystem, it takes the guesswork away from entrepreneurs and innovators as to where to go for assistance, Beier said.
Purdue Innovates has developed a strategic plan that emphasizes the importance of collaboration, proactive investment in promising research and targeted outreach to key stakeholders through new initiatives and events at the university. Some examples include:
Purdue University proactively reaches out to faculty members who have research with startup potential. To bridge the gap between research and commercialization, new funds will be created in the coming months. This will encourage the development of new ideas and facilitate the translation of research into real-world solutions. As one example, the John Martinson Entrepreneurial Center (JMEC) will partner with Purdue Innovates’ Purdue Ventures to manage the JMEC investment fund.
To support Purdue alumni entrepreneurs, the Inaugural Entrepreneurial Alumni Reunion is added to the fall 2023 calendar. This entrepreneurship-themed event will take place in November, providing a platform for networking, collaboration and talent resources for startups, industry, alumni, investors, students and faculty. By building a community of Purdue entrepreneurs, Purdue Innovates is fostering future Boilermaker successes that will solve the world’s greatest challenges. Learn more about the event here: org/entrepreneurial-alumni-reunion
Purdue Innovates will be promoted and communicated through new-student orientations and events like Boiler Gold Rush and new faculty orientation.
The success of Purdue Innovates is reliant on several key metrics.
The impact on intellectual property generation and impact can be assessed through metrics like invention disclosures, licensed technologies, filed patents, issued patents and license income.
For startup creation, metrics include the amount of private capital raised by startups formed by Purdue alumni, students and faculty, the number of successful Series A round companies, and the number of Purdue students hired by early-stage startups as interns or full-time employees.
Intellectual Property Commercialization: Translating ideas into impact begins in the Office of Technology Commercialization, where Purdue innovators can file technology disclosures. Contact Disclose@prf.org to get started.
Startup Creation: Whether validating and de-risking an idea in the Incubator, finding early-stage support in the Startup Foundry or securing investments through the Ventures team, Purdue Innovates is the entrepreneurial front door for faculty, students, alumni and investors. Contact Startups@purdue.edu to begin that journey.
Purdue University innovations can be found in all 50 U.S. states and in over 100 countries around the world. Millions of people benefit from the cutting-edge research that takes place at Purdue. The Office of Technology Commercialization is the conduit for Purdue research to create new markets, solve real-world problems and drive new revenue streams for current and future Purdue innovations.
Hundreds of Purdue innovations are licensed and optioned every year, and OTC has a streamlined process for licensing so a company can get a new product into market quickly. The team offers different types of licensing agreements where thousands of Purdue innovations are available – ranging from the world’s whitest paint and digital forestry to smart concrete and cancer therapies, to name a few.Licensees of Purdue IP include companies large and small. For example, GeniPhys raised a $6 million Series A round, and the company was founded by Sherry Harbin, a Purdue professor who holds a joint appointment in the College of Engineering and College of Veterinary Medicine. GeniPhys’s polymerizable collagen innovation addresses unmet needs across a variety of potential markets after it worked with the Office of Technology Commercialization to license the intellectual property.
In 2013 the Purdue Foundry was launched by Purdue Research Foundation to amplify the impact of the intellectual property being developed at Purdue. It served as a hub for practical entrepreneurial support that helped Purdue entrepreneurs turn their ideas into successful businesses, taking their innovations out of the laboratory and academia and into the global market. Since the inception of Purdue Foundry, PRF has helped launch more than 350 companies, which raised more than $877 million.
Purdue was also ranked third nationally in startup creation by IPWatchdog Institute in 2020. Such resources led to many successes for Purdue-connected startups. For instance, Socio, a social media application developed by a group of Purdue University undergraduate students, including Joe Watkins, earned the founders a Forbes 30 Under 30 award in 2020. In July 2021, Cisco acquired Socio, now known as Webex Events.
“We are proud of our past accomplishments but strive to raise the bar a level higher,” Beier said. “We want to continue seeing Purdue technologies make an impact on the world via our commercialization and licensing partners, as well as our Purdue-connected startups receiving Series A investment and beyond, and our students getting exposure to startup internship and employment opportunities during their time on campus. Purdue Innovates is the culmination of all these past successes, and we will continue to build on them.”
Brooke Beier, senior vice president of Purdue Innovates: “We want the Purdue community to see the real-world success stories of commercialization and entrepreneurship coming out of Purdue Innovates and be inspired to take on the process themselves.
“We will be here to assist in that journey, whether they choose to embark on it as a Purdue student, faculty member or later in their career as an alum. Boilermakers are some of the most loyal and entrepreneurial-minded alumni, and Purdue Innovates welcomes the opportunity to engage and discuss how it can assist with the mission to make Purdue the most preeminent university for technology commercialization and startup creation.”
Abhijit Karve, director of business development and licensing in the Office of Technology Commercialization: “The partnership between the various units of Purdue Innovates will be paramount to the success of getting Purdue technologies to market whether via industry or startups.”
Justin Renfrow, new director of Incubator: “I’m eager to bring my experience in product development and my enthusiasm for assisting early-stage technologies and startups to the Purdue Innovates team. The Incubator will play a key role at the top of the funnel for advancing technology readiness levels, startup creation and de-risking, and engagement with student startups.”
Tyler Mantel, new director of Startup Foundry: “We foster an environment of support for founders while cultivating meaningful and productive connections with investors and dedicated alumni mentors. By uniting Purdue founders, funders and friends, we fuel the flight of innovation.”

President Chiang and Purdue-affiliated Veo celebrate company’s launch on campus,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University and Veo on Thursday (April 20) celebrated the launch of shared scooters and bikes on campus and in West Lafayette. Now a national leader in micromobility, Veo was founded by Purdue graduates Edwin Tan and Candice Xie in 2017. Veo deployed a mixed fleet of 500 scooters and bikes last month as students returned from spring break.
“Veo is a shining example of how a world-class education at Purdue prepares graduates to become innovators and industry leaders,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “Every time a member of our community gets on a Veo, they will be using a sustainable transportation system that exemplifies Purdue innovation in action. We couldn’t be more excited to welcome Veo home.”
Xie and Tan presented Chiang with a custom golden scooter at the press event to commemorate Veo’s launch on campus.
Tan, Veo’s president, who earned a master’s degree from the School of Mechanical Engineering, said, “Purdue’s culture of entrepreneurship and innovation provided us with the foundation to launch Veo six years ago on campus. We have now scaled to 50-plus cities nationwide, advancing our mission to make cities more livable by creating clean, accessible transportation for everyone. Purdue and West Lafayette fit perfectly into this vision, with strong ridership demand and great bike infrastructure. It’s an honor to bring our product back to the campus that played such an important role in our success.”
“As students, Edwin and I identified a need to make sustainable travel affordable and convenient – especially in bike-friendly communities like West Lafayette,” said Xie, Veo’s CEO, who received a bachelor’s degree from Purdue’s School of Management (now the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business). “Purdue provided the academic rigor and entrepreneurship resources to get us started. My time at Purdue inspired me to think differently, creatively and ambitiously. It encouraged me not to wait but to create opportunities and eventually led me to start Veo. We are thrilled to launch here and serve the community where it all began.”
Xie and Tan credit the Purdue Foundry, an entrepreneurship and commercialization accelerator on campus, for setting them up for success. The Foundry’s Entrepreneurs-In-Residence program helped them come up with a business plan and provided valuable advice.
“In 2017, Purdue Foundry identified Veo as a promising young startup with exceptional Purdue alumni founders and a vision for the future,” said Brian Edelman, president of the Purdue Research Foundation. “The Foundry is proud to see that Veo’s strong business model is scaling successfully while having a positive impact on society.”
Xie and Tan started Veo in 2017 with a business plan and big aspirations. They incubated their company at Purdue Foundry, where they created their business plan and developed their first prototype. Xie and Tan then did a small-scale pilot program with their teal-colored shared bikes around the city of West Lafayette. Their bikes quickly became a popular way to get around Purdue and the bike-friendly community of West Lafayette.
Veo now operates in over 50 markets across North America with fleets of shared electric bikes and scooters it designs and manufactures in-house. With a focus on deliberate and responsible growth, Veo in 2020 became the industry’s first profitable micromobility company. Recognized as a Forbes Best Startup Employer, the company now has over 200 employees and continues to grow as it deploys new vehicle types and enters new markets across North America. Veo’s diverse portfolio of markets includes New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington, D.C., as well as universities including the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Indiana University, Texas A&M University and Rutgers University.
“We’re excited to be partnering with Veo to provide quality, micromobility options on the West Lafayette campus,” said Rob Wynkoop, vice president for administrative operations at Purdue. “The safety of the campus community is of the utmost importance to us, and we strongly support Veo’s focus on vehicle design safety and their strong stance on safe operating practices.”

Purdue researchers featured on multiple major national broadcasts,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University is coming off a 10-day stretch in which researchers were featured on major national broadcasts, including “60 Minutes,” the “Today” show, CBS’ “Money Watch,” “PBS NewsHour” and MSNBC.
On April 9, CBS’ “60 Minutes” featured Danny Milisavljevic, an associate professor of physics and astronomy, for his collaborative work on the James Webb Space Telescope. In the interview, which took place in Washington, D.C., Milisavljevic and veteran news anchor Scott Pelley discussed how the telescope is providing never-before-seen photos of supernova explosions. The story also includes a clip of Milisavljevic  seeing a detailed photo of the Cassiopeia A supernova for the first time. The broadcast received an extra bump in national viewers as it was preceded by the final round of the Masters tournament.
As many Americans were in the final days of finishing their taxes before this week’s deadline, Thomas Godwin, an assistant professor of accounting in the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, wrote a piece for The Conversation on the history of Tax Day and why it was set for April 18 this year. The story was picked up by “PBS NewsHour” and also led to a four-minute live interview on CBS News.

Concord Law School launches new class to address rural legal issues,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Concord Law School at Purdue Global, Purdue’s online school for working adults, wants to solve the problem of “legal deserts” across the U.S.
Up to 40% of U.S. counties are legal deserts, defined as counties having one lawyer or fewer per 1,000 residents. It’s an increasing challenge communities face — whether because of the volume of legal work needed, the demand for lawyers with specific expertise, or the potential conflict-of-interest issues that could arise with some cases. And many if not most of these legal deserts are in primarily rural areas.
In response, Concord Law School is launching a course this summer, Rural Law Practice, to empower students who are considering rural law practices. Another goal is to show the legal needs of various agribusinesses and family farms while highlighting the shortage of civil and family legal services in rural communities.
Access to justice in rural areas is a priority for the Concord Law School and its renewed mission to develop partnerships with rural legal communities, said Shaun Jamison, associate dean of academics at Concord Law School at Purdue Global. And offering an online rural law course helps those who are interested in practicing rural law.
“Some lawyers in rural areas are working into their 70s and 80s, with no one to take over their practice,” Jamison said. “This could be an opportunity for more people who work in rural areas to go into the legal profession and work in the areas they live. This online course can help interested law students or lawyers from rural areas around the country to participate and learn at a reasonable cost.”
Jamison said the idea for the course stems from Purdue Global’s intimate connection to Purdue University and the public institution’s legacy and leadership in agriculture, Extension and outreach services, as well as its storied land-grant mission.
“We believe that the rural economy needs community-based lawyers and legal services. There are people serving rural communities who are serving from large metro areas or even large county seats that have large rural client bases,” Jamison said.
Topics in the new class include not only agricultural law but also succession planning, common legal issues in rural communities, family law, land use and civil law.
Hannah Catt, adjunct professor with Concord Law School at Purdue Global, will lead the class. Catt, who is passionate about rural legal issues, said it is important to understand that agriculture is often one of the largest sectors of a state’s economy. For that reason, she said, accessible legal services are essential to keep a rural economy going.
“Rural areas and rural residents are a critical piece of the U.S. — economically, culturally and politically,” said Catt, who lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas. “Rural areas are not a monolith; however, some of the common issues are difficulties in accessing legal services due to a lack of technology access, such as limited phone service or broadband access. There also are geographic barriers and a lack of attorneys in rural areas who specialize in complex fields of law.”
In addition to those challenges, students will learn the benefits of a rural legal practice, including the value of personal relationships and how living in the community you’re serving is important to be successful, Catt said. Further, the course will demonstrate how many agricultural law concepts intersect with other legal practice areas.
“My goal is that the students will not only be able to articulate the challenges facing rural clients and rural attorneys, but also how these challenges create opportunities for creative problem-solving as an attorney, making rural practice very dynamic,” Catt said.

Concord Law School grad Dolan Williams shares lessons learned – and his commitment to family,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Maybe you know the feeling. You’re settled into a comfortable job and hitting targets. Things are going well. Then it happens. The rumor mills start creaking into motion, and with one word, your heart sinks: layoffs.
That’s exactly where Dolan Williams found himself in 2010.
“There were probably three major rounds of layoffs per year,” Williams says. “I knew it was a matter of time before I was next. I decided that I needed to make a change, but I just didn’t know what that was.”
With his wife at home taking care of their three children and a fourth on the way, there was added pressure.
Then he got a crazy idea. He turned to his wife and asked, “What if I became a lawyer?”
Backed by his family, Williams discovered Concord Law School at Purdue Global, Purdue’s online university for working adults. Its reputation and flexibility made it a good choice for him and his family.
Read Williams’ full story on The Perisistent Pursuit website.

"Purdue convenes CHIPS summit in D.C. with Sec. Raimondo and Sen. Young, announces sustainability index and facility investment","summarize:Video: Purdue is leading the way to fulfill U.S. semiconductor needs.
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Leaders from industry, government and academia convened at a summit Tuesday (April 18) in Washington, D.C. to forge national solutions at scale to address the future of U.S. innovation in microelectronics and the semiconductor workforce.
The  full-day CHIPS for America: Execute for Success Summit in Washington, D.C., led by Purdue and U.S. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana at the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C., convened hundreds of attendees representing over 175 entities from over 23 states, and focused on strategies to execute the vision outlined in the recently released CHIPS for America: Vision for Success. It highlighted the implementation of federal investments and future policy actions, and facilitated the creation of government, industry and academic partnerships with a special focus on workforce development and research innovation.
President Mung Chiang and chief semiconductor officer Mark Lundstrom represented Purdue, which partnered with SEMI, the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, to host the summit.
Keynoting the day, Chiang led a fireside chat with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Sen. Young, and several panel discussions featured leaders from industry, government and academia sharing their perspectives on how to best execute the vision for CHIPS Act workforce development and R&D programs.
“This is our silicon moment, to execute the CHIPS Act for success,” Chiang said. “As we celebrate the 75 years since the invention of transistor in Bell Labs, we can only imagine what the next 75 years of semiconductors innovation might look like.”
Raimondo, who visited Purdue in fall 2022 along with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, said at the summit: “I was blown away by what I saw when I visited Purdue, in so far as, in my assessment, it is exactly what the United States needs to be doing. Real robust partnering as between top research universities, like Purdue, and industry, but also the integration of community colleges and also high schools.”
She added: “More people need to continue to do what Purdue is doing: allowing students class credit for applied work at companies, allowing companies to come into the universities, making sure that the students are job ready when they graduate.”
Reflecting on last September’s visit to Purdue by Raimondo and Blinken, Young said, “There’s a lot of excitement in the air about what might follow. … What I’ve been encouraged about on the back end of that gathering is that our state has really operationalized many of the opportunities. We’re putting together a tech-hub package. Purdue University and some other institutions are developing new workforce training programs for these key sectors. Indiana is really poised to play a (significant) role as it relates to semiconductors but also any of the other emerging technologies that we need to invest in.”
Other speakers at the summit included Ramin Toloui, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs at the U.S. Department of State; Dr. Dev Shenoy, principal director of microelectronics with the U.S. Department of Defense; Dr. Eric Lin, interim director, CHIPS Research and Development, U.S. Department of Commerce; and Dr. Erwin Gianchandani, assistant director of the Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships at the National Science Foundation, as well as leaders from Applied Materials, Everspin Technologies, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, Intel, Micron, SEMI, the Semiconductor Industry Association, Semiconductor Research Corporation, and SkyWater. They shared their perspectives on the challenges ahead, ways to measure progress and how to sustain the effort over the long term. Barbara Snyder, President of the Association of American Universities, made concluding remarks about the multiple roles a leading research university like Purdue plays in the success of CHIPS Act.
At the beginning of the fireside chat with Raimondo and Young, Chiang announced partnerships with industry to create the Sustainability Capability for Semiconductors Index (SCSI), with the vision of integrating and operationalizing sustainable engineering principles and methods across the entire semiconductor industry. The effort calls for addressing the economic, environmental, and societal dimensions of sustainability in the development of materials, processes, systems, products, supply chains, and enterprises. The sustainable semiconductor manufacturing initiative builds upon decades of expertise and the experience of faculty members from across the university. These includes some of the world’s leading experts on industrial sustainability and semiconductor design/manufacturing.
Carol Handwerker, the Reinhardt Schuhmann, Jr. Professor of Materials Engineering and an environmental and ecological engineering professor, notes that “the initiative leverages ongoing industry engagements with the SEMI Climate Consortium, imec, SkyWater, Seagate, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, etc.”  In moving forward, the initiative will undertake sustainability education and workforce development, in addition to improving process and product designs through sustainability-driven research innovations.
Additionally, Purdue announced this week the creation of a Purdue Presidential Semiconductor Task Force led by Lundstrom, the university’s first chief semiconductor officer, which will coordinate and lead Purdue’s efforts toward innovative research and development in semiconductors.
Lundstrom said the CHIPS Act is a once-in-a-generation investment, offering opportunities to bolster continuing faculty work at launching the nation’s largest and most comprehensive workforce development program. It also spurred Purdue plans for new, innovative research programs and its work with the state of Indiana to grow an emerging semiconductor ecosystem.
More than 25 companies that have members on the Purdue Semiconductor Degrees Leadership Board sent industrial representatives to the summit and met with Purdue staff afterward. The board was established to provide visionary input for Purdue’s semiconductors degrees program.
As part of Purdue Computes, a three-pronged strategic initiative launched on April 14 to further scale Purdue’s research and educational excellence in the future of computing, and recognizing that computing takes place in chips, Purdue announced the investment of Phase 1 $49 million in semiconductor cleanroom upgrade and a planned Phase 2 of another $51 million to help create an open innovation ecosystem.
“Birck Nanotechnology Center has for decades been a critical home for discovery and technology development, both for Purdue researchers and those from industry and other universities who use our facilities,” says Zhihong Chen, the Mary Jo and Robert L. Kirk Director of the Birck Nanotechnology Center. “This investment will ensure that we maintain our state-of-the-art facilities, reclaim more space, and establish new capabilities for semiconductor R&D.”
Upgrades will include procurement of specialized equipment for device fabrication and characterization, and effort to increase capacity in the 25,000-square-foot Scifres Nanofabrication Laboratory cleanroom, one of the largest academic cleanrooms in the nation. It will include a dedicated training bay for use in training those enrolled in the university’s Semiconductor Degrees Program, such as Purdue undergrads, Ivy Tech students, and engineers in the field.
The upgrades will also create dedicated cleanroom and lab space for advanced packaging research – innovations in design, materials, and processing that are needed to integrate chiplets with different functionalities – and shared quantum transport and characterization facilities, which are important to future electronic and quantum information science applications. Work will begin immediately and is expected to be completed in August 2024. The installation of new equipment in the renovated space will start in the first quarter of 2024.
“As we continue to push the boundaries of scientific discovery, our commitment to advancing nanoscale science and engineering is unwavering,” says Karen Plaut, executive vice president for research. “Purdue’s investment in our facilities demonstrates our dedication to providing state-of-the-art resources for our esteemed researchers and students, empowering them to advance critical semiconductor technology and engage in groundbreaking research in other areas of nanoelectronics, quantum computing, and more.”

Purdue leadership forms task force to take growing semiconductors program to next level,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A new Purdue University task force devoted to semiconductors and microelectronics has reasserted the university’s focus on helping the U.S. regain preeminence in the industry.
The President’s Semiconductor Task Force will coordinate and lead Purdue’s efforts toward innovative research and development through the CHIPS for America and Science Act, approved in Washington, D.C., last year. The task force will consist of faculty experts from several areas of Purdue microelectronics.
Leading the new task force is Mark Lundstrom, who steps into a new role as chief semiconductor officer for Purdue and senior advisor to President Mung Chiang. Lundstrom, the Don and Carol Scifres Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, most recently served as interim dean for the College of Engineering.
Lundstrom said the CHIPS Act is a once-in-a-generation investment, offering opportunities to bolster continuing faculty work at launching the nation’s largest and most comprehensive workforce development program. It also spurred Purdue plans for new, innovative research programs and its work with the state of Indiana to grow an emerging semiconductor ecosystem.
“Faculty continue to work tirelessly to advance Purdue’s semiconductor programs and to help Indiana develop its emerging microelectronics industry,” Lundstrom said. “Having worked in semiconductors for my entire career, I can say that there has never been a more important time for Purdue, Indiana and the nation.”
A member of the Purdue faculty since 1980, Lundstrom’s research and teaching at Purdue have focused on the physics, modeling and simulation of semiconductor devices. Lundstrom was founding director of the National Science Foundation-funded Network for Computational Nanotechnology, a multi-university initiative with a mission to accelerate the evolution of nanoscience to nanotechnology by connecting those who develop simulations to those who use them to analyze experiments and design devices.
The task force is the latest addition to the Semiconductors@Purdue initiative, which addresses workforce development, research and economic development. Purdue announced the nation’s first comprehensive semiconductor degree program in 2022.
Purdue expanding semiconductor research and development already runs the gamut of disciplines in the field, from materials and devices, to circuits, systems, architecture, and advanced packaging integration. Strong connections in industry, defense and the National Science Foundation further support Purdue’s research.
The President’s Semiconductor Task Force includes:
Carol Handwerker, the Reinhardt Schuhmann, Jr. Professor of Materials Engineering and an environmental and ecological engineering professor.
Joerg Appenzeller, the Barry M. and Patricia L. Epstein Professor of ECE and scientific director of nanoelectronics in the Birck Nanotechnology Center.
Vijay Raghunathan, associate head of ECE and director of Purdue’s Semiconductor Degrees Program (SDP).
Ganesh Subbarayan, the James G. Dwyer Professor of Mechanical Engineering.
Zhihong Chen, professor of ECE and director of the Birck Nanotechnology Center.
Peter Bermel, the Elmore Associate Professor of ECE and director of SCALE.
Cristina Farmus, vice president for special projects.
Handwerker and Appenzeller will serve as senior fellows on the task force, while Raghunathan and Subbarayan will serve as fellows on the task force.
“Purdue is the first university out of the gate and attracting attention nationally and internationally for our commitment and quick start on addressing this ambitious challenge,” Lundstrom said. “It won’t be easy, but we are well-positioned for success.”
Semiconductor and microelectronics work is a core piece of Purdue moving forward. SCALE (Scalable Asymmetric Lifecycle Engagement) is a Department of Defense microelectronics workforce development program headed by Purdue’s College of Engineering. The program brings together faculty from 16 other universities and experts from 34 industry partners – including the Department of Defense, NASA and the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration – to give students access to internships, careers and cutting-edge research opportunities in semiconductors.
Working with Bermel on the leadership of SCALE are Kerrie Douglas, associate director, and Tamara Moore, SCALE K-12 director.
SDP complements SCALE by addressing the needs of the commercial semiconductor industry. Working in close collaboration with 27 senior leaders of the semiconductor industry, the program is a model curriculum to address the critical shortage of semiconductor talent that the U.S. semiconductor industry faces. The program engages students in six different engineering disciplines and involves more that 50 semiconductor faculty. Working with Raghunathan in the leadership of SDP are associate directors Muhammad Hussain and Mark Johnson.
Purdue’s semiconductor research, an important part of the initiative, is anchored by six major centers:
Center for Heterogeneous Integration Research on Packaging (CHIRP) directed by Subbarayan.
Center for NEW materials for LogIc, Memory, and InTerconnectS (NEWLIMITS), directed by Chen.
Center for Secure Microelectronics Ecosystems (CSME), co-directed by Appenzeller and Anand Raghunathan, the Silicon Valley Professor of ECE.
Cooling Technologies Research Center (CTRC) directed by Justin Weibel, a mechanical engineering professor.
Center for Brain Inspired Computing (C-BRIC), directed by Kaushik Roy, the Edward G. Tiedemann Jr. Distinguished Professor of ECE.
Network for Computational Nanotechnology (nanoHUB) led by director Gerhard Klimeck, an ECE professor, and deputy director Alejandro Strachan.
Investments in the future workforce and semiconductor research have also drawn innovative neighbors to Purdue. U.S.-owned semiconductor manufacturer SkyWater Technology and Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc., the world’s fourth-largest chip designer by revenue, have each announced partnerships with Purdue in the last year.
SkyWater plans to open a $1.8 billion state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facility in Discovery Park District at Purdue, a 400-acre, mixed-use development adjacent to campus. This will provide investing companies access to both Purdue University faculty experts and highly sought-after graduates prepared to work in the industry.
Building the company’s first semiconductor chip design center in the Midwest and the first to be housed directly on a university campus, MediaTek Inc. will provide an opportunity for students to complete their engineering education and contribute directly to product design and solutions for a global team.
Purdue has also partnered with Ivy Tech Community College, the nation’s largest singly accredited statewide community college system, to develop industry-driven credentials and experiential programs. The collaboration brings Purdue’s resources to populations that may not have had access to this type of program while upskilling a motivated workforce.

"Purdue launches Purdue Mobile ID for students, allowing them to get around campus with just a simple tap of their mobile device","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University West Lafayette ID Card Operations/Support, in partnership with Student Life and Purdue Information Technology, has launched the new Purdue Mobile ID. Purdue students can now add their ID to Apple Wallet or Google Wallet and use their iPhone, Apple Watch or Android devices to conveniently and securely access campus buildings, purchase meals and more.
“With Purdue Mobile ID, students can access designated spaces and services with a simple tap of their smartphone or smartwatch,” said Ian Hyatt, Purdue vice president of information technology and chief information officer. “As we continually look for ways that technology can enhance the Purdue experience, we are excited to offer students the convenience they expect while maintaining security.”
Through Purdue Mobile ID, students can simply hold their device near a reader to access residence halls and campus buildings, make transactions using BoilerExpress, use their meal plans and even pay for laundry. The new Purdue Mobile ID for students is enabled for smartphones via Transact Mobile Credentials.
“Using a Purdue Mobile ID makes life so much easier,” said Ohinoiyi Momoh, an undergraduate student in the College of Liberal Arts. “It’s a lot more convenient to keep on my mobile device and makes it extremely easy to get into dining courts and my residence hall. I think students will appreciate having a Purdue Mobile ID.”
Current students will still be able to keep and use physical ID cards as well as their Purdue Mobile ID. In addition to the new Purdue Mobile ID, graduate students may still need physical cards because some academic buildings, labs and other facilities may still require the physical Purdue ID card for access in the short term.
Beginning this summer, all incoming undergraduate Purdue students will move to the Purdue Mobile ID and not be issued a physical ID card. This is part of the university’s Mobile First strategy, which seeks to eliminate the need for hard-copy ID cards for Purdue’s 50,000 students on the West Lafayette campus over the next few years.
The move from physical cards to Purdue Mobile ID on iPhone, Apple Watch or Android devices allows for transactions that are safe, convenient and secure, and helps students avoid handing their ID cards to someone else. Purdue can also issue school IDs remotely without the need for students to request a mobile Purdue ID in person, eliminating the need to print and mail physical cards and creating a safer, more cost-effective and more environmentally friendly process.
“We’re thrilled to build on our on-campus experience and roll out Purdue Mobile ID to our students,” said Loribeth Hettinger, senior associate bursar of ID Card Operations/Support. “This will greatly simplify some of our bottlenecks by streamlining our ID card distribution processes to our incoming freshmen while also meeting student expectations – and even save them the time and resources they end up spending when losing a physical card.”
The Purdue Mobile ID effort is being launched specifically for the student population on the West Lafayette campus; faculty and staff will continue to use physical IDs and are not participating in the Purdue Mobile ID program.
“We know that Purdue students have high expectations for their technology solutions, and mobile credentialing naturally fits in this space,” said Beth McCuskey, vice provost for Purdue Student Life. “We are excited to launch Purdue Mobile ID as a new way to enhance the student experience.”
Purdue has been laying the groundwork to launch Transact Mobile Credentials since 2013, first by updating campus infrastructure for door readers and point-of-sale devices to be mobile-ready. Purdue is installing contactless and tap-to-pay technology using the Transact system through a phased approach across campus.
Department heads who have special-use cases for the Purdue ID and want to ensure their ID use cases and technology supports Purdue Mobile ID can reach out to ID Card Operations/Support for options and support. Hettinger and her team are working with faculty, staff and student organizations on special-use cases – from attendance tracking to door entry, for example – to ensure a smooth experience for the unit as well as students. There are various technology solutions to fit each need, and options are available to rent equipment for special events as needed. For more information, go here.

Computer Science synergies across Science and Engineering; Purdue invests in computing to meet student need,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
As student interests in computing-related majors and societal impact of AI and chips continue to rise rapidly, Purdue University announced a major initiative, Purdue Computes.
Purdue Computes consists of three pillars: academic resource of computing departments, strategic artificial intelligence research, and semiconductor education and research. This story highlights the first pillar – academic resource of computing departments:
A wave of top-notch hirings will bring 50 new faculty to computer science, computer engineering and related departments in the next five years, with a goal of reaching top 10 in the U.S.
The Department of Computer Science in the College of Science will have a secondary affiliation in the College of Engineering, further enhancing collaboration opportunities with faculty and students. Bi-collegiate collaboration efforts are a proven benefit, following the model of agricultural and biological engineering, which ranks No. 1 nationally. Productive collaboration with computer engineering in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, which offers minor in AI applications, will be carried out.
“A strategic investment like this in our computing departments generates the kind of momentum to fuel faculty and staff research efforts as well as bring the best and brightest to the Purdue campus. This builds on the legacy of Purdue having the nation’s first department in 1962 and allows us to reach new heights among the national leaders,” said Provost Patrick Wolfe.
The goals continue an upward trajectory for computer science at Purdue. The computer science program moved up to 16th in the nation in September’s U.S. News & World Report undergraduate rankings. The jump was bolstered by the addition of new majors in artificial intelligence and in data science. Cybersecurity and software engineering both ranked in the top 10, while artificial intelligence moved up five places, to 19th, and data analytics received a ranking for the first time at No. 13.
Further development of the computing departments is expected to create new enrollment opportunities for Purdue University in Indianapolis, where computer science, computer engineering and related areas form part of the foundation of the new, urban extension of West Lafayette campus, and the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, where business analytics and integrated business engineering are two of the most sought-after degrees.
The future under Purdue Computes’ innovative goals stands as a testament to the university’s initial prominence. In 1962-63, Purdue announced the first degree-awarding computer science program in the United States. It was founded by Purdue professor Samuel D. Conte and has seen continuous growth during its 60-year history.

"Purdue launches nation’s first Institute for Physical AI (IPAI), recruiting 50 new faculty","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
As student interests in computing-related majors and societal impact of artificial intelligence and chips continue to rise rapidly, Purdue University’s Board of Trustees announced Friday (April 14) a major initiative, Purdue Computes.
Purdue Computes is made up of three pillars: academic resource of the computing departments, strategic AI research, and semiconductor education and innovation. This story highlights Pillar 2: strategic research in AI.
At the intersection between the virtual and the physical, Purdue will leapfrog to prominence between the bytes of AI and the atoms of growing, making and moving things: the university and state’s long-standing strength.
The Purdue Institute for Physical AI (IPAI) will be the cornerstone of the university’s unprecedented push into bytes-meet-atoms research. By developing both foundational AI and its applications to “We Grow, We Make, We Move,” faculty will transform AI development through physical applications, and vice versa.
IPAI’s creation is based on extensive faculty input and unique strength of research excellence at Purdue. Open agricultural data, neuromorphic computing, deep fake detection, edge AI systems, smart transportation data and AI-based manufacturing are among the variety of cutting-edge topics to be explored by IPAI through several current and emerging university research centers. The centers are the backbone of the IPAI, building upon Purdue’s existing and developing AI and cybersecurity strengths as well as workforce development. New degrees and certificates for both residential and online students will be developed for students interested in physical AI.
“Through this strategic research leadership, Purdue is focusing current and future assets on areas that will carry research into the next generation of technology,” said Karen Plaut, executive vice president of research. “Successes in the lab and the classroom on these topics will help tomorrow’s leaders tackle the world’s evolving challenges.”
A steering committee of 17 faculty members features a multidisciplinary group of individuals from many of Purdue’s colleges and departments across campus.
IPAI will include an advisory board consisting of alumni in leadership positions throughout the AI industry. This includes Tesla, Intel, Apple and Ring.
Purdue’s leadership in defining physical AI also will be supported by the recruitment of 50 new faculty during the next five years, tenure-homed at departments in colleges throughout the campus while holding affiliation with IPAI. This addition will be bolstered by 250 Presidential Doctoral Excellence Awards to be deployed to recruit the best PhD students in the field over the same period.
Industry collaboration is a planned hallmark of Purdue’s AI ambitions. Eli Lilly and Company, on AI in drug discovery and pharmaceutical manufacturing, and High Alpha, on AI based startup creation, are among the Indiana industries that will partner with the university, especially in joint research talent recruiting and workforce development.

Purdue researchers combine electric poling and 3D printing into a single step,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Manufacturers of smart medical devices, smart robots and other products with smart sensors could simplify their device design and fabrication using a patent-pending Purdue University method that combines piezoelectric poling of filament and 3D printing in a single process.
Traditional sensor materials have piezoelectric properties that make them suitable to create smart sensors. Applying stress in one direction produces voltage in another direction. Although these materials measure how much stress is applied, which is among the basic properties of sensors, they cannot be used in 3D printing.
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has several advantages over traditional manufacturing, including customizing parts’ shapes and geometries beyond planar options. However, the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdf) filament used in 3D printing doesn’t have strong piezoelectric properties. Its dipoles are randomly oriented, which produces less voltage. As a result, traditional PVdf filament isn’t a good indicator of stress, and electric poling must be conducted in a post-processing treatment, increasing time and cost.
Purdue researchers in the Purdue Polytechnic Institute have combined 3D printing and electric poling into a single process called electric poling-assisted additive manufacturing, or EPAM. It aligns the dipoles in PVdf filament during the print, which leads to a better indication of stress that is being applied. This allows 3D-printed parts to have both strong sensing abilities and customized shapes. Importantly, it saves time and money.
Robert Nawrocki, assistant professor in the School of Engineering Technology in the Purdue Polytechnic Institute, said the EPAM process accomplishes stretching and poling simultaneously, which are necessary conditions for the polarization.
“During the EPAM process, stretching the molten PVdF rod rearranges the amorphous strands in the film plane, and the applied electric field aligns dipoles toward the same direction,” Nawrocki said. “The EPAM process can print free-form PVdF structures and induce the formation of β-phase, which is primarily responsible for the piezoelectric response.”
Jose M. Garcia-Bravo and Brittany Newell, associate professors of in the School of Engineering Technology, Nawrocki and PhD candidate Jinsheng Fan successfully printed PVdf force sensors with a fused deposition modeling 3D printer with a corona electric poling setup.
“The piezoelectric activity, measured in picocoulombs per newton, or pC/N, was calculated based on the piezoelectric output voltage,” Nawrocki said. “The average piezoelectric activity of EPAM-printed PVdF films was 47.76 pC/N, or about five times higher than unpoled 3D-printed films, at 9.0 pC/N. The piezoelectric activity of unpoled 3D-printed PVdF films indicated that 3D printing in the absence of an electric field did not result in dipole alignment.”
Nawrocki disclosed the innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for patent protection on the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in further developing the technology should contact Dhananjay Sewak, dsewak@prf.org, about 2022-NAWR-69857.
The next steps to commercialize the EPAM method are to build a single 3D printing machine that can print all of the sensor components, including live-poled PVdF, electrodes and also the structure.
The research was published in the July 2022 issue of Advanced Engineering Materials and the December 2022 issue of Additive Manufacturing. Nawrocki and the research team received funding and other support from Purdue University.

"Trustees approve 1,000 beds for student housing via resolution with Purdue Research Foundation","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University trustees on Friday (April 14) approved a resolution confirming their support for development by the Purdue Research Foundation of a close to 1,000-bed student housing project at Third Street and McCormick Road in West Lafayette.
The project will consist of 401 units serving primarily Purdue students. Initially the project is expected to house almost 1,000 students.
The project was approved by the Tippecanoe County Area Plan Commission in April 2022, and construction is currently anticipated to begin this summer to allow occupancy for the Fall 2025 semester. The expedited availability of the project provides additional flexibility to Purdue and the West Lafayette community in meeting identified housing needs.
Purdue staff also confirmed that a detailed study is underway to develop a new student housing facility adjacent to the existing Hillenbrand Residence Hall. The university anticipates the Board of Trustees will consider a new facility project for approval this summer.
One of the key goals of Purdue’s transformative education initiative is increasing student success and value by adding housing capacity to ensure there are on-campus living opportunities for undergraduate students at the university’s West Lafayette campus.
Earlier this year, Purdue President Mung Chiang directed the creation of the Action Council on Student Housing and Wellbeing under the leadership of Provost Patrick Wolfe and Chief Financial Officer Chris Ruhl.
Since 2013 Purdue enrollment has increased 31%, while the number of on-campus beds will have increased 35% after the new projects described today are completed.
“After the Third-McCormick and Hillenbrand South residences come online, availability for student housing will substantially further increase at Purdue,” Chiang said. “Our university again reaffirmed the importance of residential learning for Boilermakers.”

"Purdue announces 3-pronged ‘Purdue Computes’ initiative: Propel Computer Science to the nation’s top 10, launch the Institute of Physical AI and expand semiconductor facilities","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
As student interest in computing-related majors and the societal impact of AI and semiconductor chips continues to rise rapidly, Purdue University and its Board of Trustees announced Friday (April 14) a major initiative, Purdue Computes, consisting of three dimensions.
The first pillar of Purdue Computes is a significant investment in Purdue’s computing faculty:
The Department of Computer Science, which became America’s first such department 60 years ago and today offers degrees including computer science, data science and artificial intelligence, will be strategically positioned to continue its rapid upward trajectory, with the target of achieving a top 10 national ranking before the end of this decade.
Similar to the Purdue model of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, which has ranked No. 1 in the country, Computer Science will now have affiliations with both the College of Science and the College of Engineering, to maximize both external impact and internal opportunities for cross-disciplinary engagement. Productive collaborations spanning computer engineering and other areas in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, which offers a minor in AI applications, will follow.
Over the next five years, across Computer Science, Computer Engineering and related departments, 50 new top-notch faculty hires are anticipated, along with staff and support resources to ensure quality education for some of the fastest-growing undergraduate and graduate programs on campus.
“We have a remarkable situation whereby Purdue has generated enormous upward momentum while simultaneously tripling its undergraduate enrollments in Computer Science,” Provost Patrick Wolfe said. “With additional investment and a focus on exceptionally high-quality faculty, this momentum will accelerate further. Great things are in the future at Purdue.”
The second pillar of Purdue Computes comprises research spanning strategically selected areas in artificial intelligence, especially at the intersection between the virtual and the physical where Purdue can leapfrog to prominence, between the bytes of AI and the atoms of growing, making and moving things in the long-standing strength of the university and the state:
A universitywide research Institute of Physical AI (IPAI) will be launched by early September. A faculty steering committee has been formed with broad participation by many colleges and departments across campus. An advisory board has been formed, with outstanding alumni from leadership positions in the AI industry participating.
Over the next five years, 50 new top-notch faculty will be recruited, with primary appointments in various academic departments and affiliation with IPAI, and over the same time span a total of 250 Presidential Doctoral Excellence Awards will be deployed to recruit the best PhD students in the field. Some of the new faculty hires will naturally overlap with those in the first pillar.
A range of current centers in AI and closely related areas representing existing research strength at Purdue provides a foundation for rapid growth in research excellence in physical AI, including open agricultural data, neuromorphic computing, deep fake detection, edge AI systems, smart transportation data, AI-based manufacturing, etc. Nationally prominent open data sets will also be created and curated.
Close collaboration with Indiana industries, such as with Eli Lilly and Company on AI in drug discovery and pharmaceutical manufacturing and with High Alpha on AI-based startup creation, will be carried out, especially in joint research talent recruiting and in workforce development.
“The Institute of Physical AI will couple scientists from across Purdue who bring interdisciplinary thinking and problem solving to solve issues at the intersection of AI and a variety of critical functions, such as more efficient pharmaceutical manufacturing, digital forestry and more efficient transportation,” said Karen Plaut, executive vice president of research.
The third pillar recognizes that all computing, including AI, takes place in physical substrates such as semiconductor chips, and further amplifies Purdue’s dominant position today in the education, research and industry partnership in semiconductors:
$100 million of semiconductor facilities is planned, with Phase 1 of $49 million approved Friday (April 14) by the Board of Trustees for capital project and equipment procurement to upgrade the 20-year-old national treasure Birck Nanotechnology Center.
The new facility and equipment will further position Purdue as a national leader in workforce through the Semiconductor Degrees Program, in research through CHIPS and Science Act-funded national institutes, and in partnership with both the industry supply chain and like-minded nations globally.
“Purdue is leading the charge in semiconductor research and education,” said Mark Lundstrom, chief semiconductor officer, who is leading the universitywide semiconductors task force. “State-of-the-art facilities like the Birck Nanotechnology Center provide the foundation for new and exciting research in many facets of microelectronics and support our workforce development initiatives.”
Early next week, more details will be announced on each of the three pillars of Purdue Computes.
“Purdue Computes takes three interrelated, strategic focus areas to the next giant leaps at our university, with participation from and benefit to many parts of campus,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “When it comes to computing, AI and chips, areas that will redefine the entire economy and society in every way imaginable, the strategic hiring, structuring and investment announced today enables Purdue University to advance at the forefront, with unparalleled excellence at scale in the country.”
“Purdue’s Board of Trustees is excited to support Purdue Computes, an initiative of tremendous strategic value for Purdue to advance as a top university in the world and take global leadership in these areas that matter significantly to both our own students and the entire society,” said Michael Berghoff, board chair. “Along with Purdue in Indianapolis and the Daniels School of Business, a connected set of strategic focus areas has emerged this year with clarity and momentum.”

Autonomous transport made more inclusive by Purdue,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
When Brad Duerstock was 18, a spinal cord injury paralyzed his arms and legs, requiring him to use what control he had left in his hands to operate a power wheelchair.
Throughout the more than 30 years since, Duerstock has seen smartphones, tablets and other types of technology get developed but not become usable for him or others with disabilities until years later. “It’s always been a retroactive accommodation,” he said.
Duerstock, a professor of practice in industrial engineering and biomedical engineering at Purdue University, is working to change that for autonomous vehicles while the technology is still in its early days. The goal is that when these vehicles start to hit the road everywhere, they will be able to accommodate anyone who wants to use them.

Purdue Global’s Concord Law School celebrates 25 years of audacity,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Even in an age of ubiquitous smartphones, Wi-Fi and broadband internet access, online learning was still new and unfamiliar for many when COVID-19 hit in March 2020, forcing millions of Americans to work and study from home.
So imagine how audacious it was to propose launching an online law school back in 1998 – a time when U.S. Census data shows that only a quarter of American households included someone who accessed the internet at home.
The nation’s first fully online law school, Concord opened its virtual doors in October 1998 with 33 students and two professors. It has helped more than 2,600 students obtain Juris Doctor or Executive Juris Doctor degrees in the 25 years since, with alumni residing in all 50 states and more than two dozen foreign countries.
“The idea that someone was doing it for almost a quarter-century before the pandemic blows people’s minds, as well it should,” says Martin Pritikin, who since 2016 has served as dean and vice president of what is now known as Concord Law School at Purdue Global. “When the idea for Concord started back in 1998, most people, including myself, still had a dial-up internet connection. The internet was not well developed at that point, and the idea of having a fully online law school was really audacious.
However, it makes sense on numerous fronts. For starters, Concord does not face the expensive burden of maintaining a physical campus, so it is able to provide a relevant legal education at one-third the cost of traditional law schools. In addition, Concord’s online format makes it an attractive option for nontraditional students who might not otherwise be able to attend law school, including:
Working adults who want to change careers or alter their current career trajectories.
Active military who are unsure where they will be stationed or deployed from year to year.
Those caring for dependents who can’t manage a night-school schedule.
Students who live too far from a law school campus and can’t afford to commute.
Those with physical disabilities for whom travel is difficult.
Concord Law School is part of Purdue Global, which is Purdue’s online university for working adults.

Purdue University in Indianapolis’ IAC creates significant savings for Indiana businesses,"summarize:INDIANAPOLIS —
Energy cost is a major concern for industry. It may not be a stressor for manufacturing giants, which have the budget and personnel to handle their own energy assessments. But what about the small- and medium-sized business owners in Indiana who run the bakery down the street or your favorite local brewery?
Purdue University in Indianapolis professor Jie Chen, his colleagues and students at the university’s Industrial Assessment Center are working to put Indiana small- to medium-sized business owners’ minds at ease when it comes to energy expenditures.
Thanks to an ongoing grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, the IAC at Purdue University in Indianapolis has trained an energy efficiency workforce to perform over 170 energy audits on small- to medium-sized Indiana businesses since 2011. Under the leadership of engineering faculty with energy audit credentials, a team of highly skilled students conduct energy assessments, which result in comprehensive reports given to each manufacturer with recommendations for improving energy efficiency, reducing waste and increasing productivity. The reports provide energy efficiency recommendations, identify potential savings with detailed calculations, estimate implementation costs and compute payback times.
“Big companies have the capability to hire people strictly to work on energy, but many small to medium-sized enterprises don’t have those resources,” said Chen, IAC director and chair of mechanical and energy engineering at Purdue University in Indianapolis. “The small and medium-sized manufacturers and commercial buildings use a lot of energy, so the IAC outlines the opportunities for those Indiana businesses to save.”
While each individual manufacturer determines what changes are implemented, the center’s post-assessment surveys have determined the implementation rate of the recommendations has reached more than 50%, a mark that holds major significance in a small-business climate, where profit margins can be notoriously thin. Dating to the center’s creation, recommendations from the IAC team have accounted for a total of more than $20 million in energy cost savings for Indiana businesses.
“The IAC team did a tremendous job with its energy assessment,” said Mary Gordon, director of operations for Electro-Spec Inc. in Franklin, Indiana. “Dr. Chen and his students compiled a comprehensive report that was extremely helpful to our business in identifying ways for us to save both energy and money.”
Ted Funk, Electro-Spec’s facilities manager, said, “The IAC’s ability to make creative and rational decisions on energy savings opportunities based on the data they examined was outstanding.”
The decadelong impact of the IAC on small- to medium-sized Indiana enterprises was initially launched by $1.3 million in DOE funding to establish the center. The IAC has earned two renewal awards since then and was recently granted $100,000 per year over a four-year period to expand its energy assessments to include small- to medium-sized commercial buildings in a 150-mile radius around Indianapolis. Total funding for the center, which was recognized by the Department of Energy as the “exemplar” of the 37 such centers on college campuses across the country, is just shy of $5 million.
Purdue University in Indianapolis is a new, fully integrated extension of the West Lafayette flagship campus, expanding the academic rigor and accessible excellence that Purdue is known for to Indiana’s industrial and technological center. As the only public top 10 university, most trusted university and most innovative university in the state of Indiana, Purdue is focused and committed to strengthening its presence in the capital city. Purdue in Indianapolis will reimagine a collaborative platform that connects students, faculty and local businesses to promote breakthrough discoveries and create a new and direct talent pipeline. Realignment of the existing IUPUI partnership is expected to be completed by the start of the fall semester in 2024.

Purdue offering new online Hypersonics Graduate Certificate,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University, a wellspring for hypersonics research, is moving to help fill the need for people trained in the field with a new 100% online Hypersonics Graduate Certificate. The program is designed for working professionals in engineering and management who want to develop a competitive edge by gaining graduate-level knowledge in hypersonics.
“The demand for this kind of knowledge has jumped exponentially in the last couple of years as it has become more important to the defense industry,” said William Crossley, the Uhrig and Vournas Head of Aeronautics and Astronautics. “We have alumni with our undergraduate degrees and with our master’s degrees who want this information. We have friends and partners of the school saying their employees need this information to help advance their knowledge base in hypersonics.”
The four-course, 12-credit program from Purdue’s highly ranked College of Engineering and School of Aeronautics and Astronautics teaches state-of-the-art methods in fluid dynamics, aerospace propulsion and materials that are integral to understanding hypersonic flight.
Students can tailor their programs from a selection of graduate-level courses taught by faculty from Purdue’s flagship West Lafayette, Indiana, campus who are internationally known as leading experts in their fields.
The curriculum is arranged along tracks focused on hypersonic aerodynamics and vehicle design; propulsion systems; and materials, particularly those designed for the high heat transfer rates in hypersonics, said Gregory Blaisdell, professor and associate head for Purdue’s Gambaro Graduate Program of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
For more information on Purdue’s 100% online Hypersonics Graduate Certificate, visit the program website.
Fast in the extreme at more than five times the speed of sound, low-flying and highly maneuverable, hypersonic aircraft and weapons systems being developed by other countries are a major concern for U.S. national security.
Hypersonics research and development also are important in the growth of commercial space travel and in efforts to return to the moon and go to Mars. Spacecraft fly at hypersonic speeds leaving Earth’s orbit as well as entering planetary atmospheres, and they must be designed, among other things, to deal with the extreme heat generated in the process.
The U.S. once was a leader in hypersonics, but budget reductions after the end of the Cold War stalled progress and allowed other countries, notably China and Russia, to continue moving ahead. Now the U.S. is in catchup mode and needs to increase its supply of people trained in the field.
Purdue’s history in hypersonics spans decades, and rapid advances underway have turned the university into America’s hypersonics research and testing epicenter. For example, Purdue is home to one of the few Mach 6 quiet wind tunnels in the world. In addition, Purdue is building a $41 million Hypersonics and Applied Research Facility, a lab that will feature the world’s first Mach 8 quiet wind tunnel and the Hypersonic Pulse (HYPULSE) reflected/shock expansion tunnel. The university also has approved plans for a first-of-its-kind Hypersonic Ground Test Center and a $73 million High Speed Propulsion Laboratory.
Purdue’s prime position in the field and its unmatched facilities have attracted a multidisciplinary team of more than 40 faculty members who, among them, are working on virtually all aspects of hypersonics. In addition to the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Hypersonics Graduate Certificate program involves faculty members from Purdue’s schools of Materials Engineering and of Mechanical Engineering.
“We have an unusually strong connection to industry and government,” said aeronautics and astronautics professor Jonathan Poggie, who oversees a large hypersonics-focused research program at Purdue. “We work closely with all the major defense contractors and with the government labs all over the country. Pulling together academia, industry and government, plus the human capital here, make our hypersonics leadership unique.”
Purdue’s online Hypersonics Graduate Certificate will draw on the university’s status as a top 10 public university, rated the No. 7 Best Value School in the U.S. (Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education, 2022), and a top 10 Most Innovative School for five years running (U.S. News & World Report 2023).
For students who want to pursue a master’s degree, credits from the Hypersonics Graduate Certificate also can be rolled into Purdue’s online Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics.

"New Webb telescope image reveals wonders, beauty, secrets of star structure and building blocks of life","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
To gaze at the stars is human. To be able to see them in three-dimensional detail is very nearly divine.
Divine vision is what the James Webb Space Telescope has granted earthbound scientists in a new near-infrared, detailed image of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), a stellar remnant – the clouds of gas, dust and other material left behind when a star dies. Danny Milisavljevic, assistant professor of physics and astronomy in Purdue University’s College of Science, studies supernova remnants and leads a year one research team on the JWST examining Cas A.
“I have spent 17 years studying stars and their titanic explosions. I’ve used dozens of telescopes – both ground- and space-based – covering the electromagnetic spectrum from gamma rays to radio wavelengths,” Milisavljevic said. “And yet, I was still unprepared for the data that Webb has provided. I am awestruck by their quality and beauty.”
Cassiopeia A is the youngest known remnant from an exploding, massive star in our galaxy, which makes it a unique opportunity to learn more about how such supernovae occur. The light from its explosion first arrived at Earth 340 years ago.
“Cas A represents our best opportunity to look at the debris field of an exploded star and run a kind of stellar autopsy to understand what type of star was there beforehand and how that star exploded,” Milisavljevic said.
Supernovae like the one that formed Cas A are crucial for life. Stars create a variety of elements, and subsequent supernovae create additional elements – everything from the calcium in our bones to the iron in our blood – and spread them across interstellar space, seeding new generations of stars and planets.
“By understanding the process of exploding stars, we are reading our own origin story,” Milisavljevic said.
Located about 11,000 light-years away, the remnant is in the section of the sky considered to be of the constellation Cassiopeia. An arrangement of five bright stars in a “W,” Cas A is invisible to human eyes from Earth but occupies the space that appears to be off to the right of the last stroke of the W.
For decades, scientists have studied Cas A. Examining the structure using different wavelengths gives astronomers new insights into star anatomy, the same way infrared cameras give humans different information than cameras that see only in the visible light spectrum.
The new image collected by JWST’s golden honeycomb of 18 mirrors shows incredible detail. In it, mid-infrared light has been translated into visible light, allowing scientists to analyze details and structures. Great curtains of material, shaded red and orange, represent where the star’s material is crashing into circumstellar gas and dust. Among those rosy swaths, bursts of pink show where the star’s composite elements, including oxygen, argon and neon, are shining.
For the researchers, one of the most puzzling elements of the image is the large green loop on the image’s right side.
“We’ve nicknamed it the Green Monster, in honor of Fenway Park in Boston,” Milisavljevic said. “If you look closely, you’ll notice that it’s pockmarked with what look like little bubbles. The shape and complexity are unexpected and challenging to understand.”
Higher resolution images, in more wavelengths especially the infrared, give astronomers a clearer look at the intricacies of the structure. Like picking up binoculars to help resolve the colors and patterns on a bird’s wing, the more detail scientists have, the more information they can infer and analyze.
“Compared to previous infrared images, we see incredible detail that we haven’t been able to access before,” said Tea Temim, a program co-investigator from Princeton University.
Counterintuitively, some of the most exciting matter in the picture may seem the most prosaic: dust. While the substance is irritating to housekeepers, it is intriguing to astronomers.
Massive quantities of dust suffuse even very young galaxies in the early universe. It’s difficult to explain the origins of this dust without crediting supernovae, which spew large quantities of heavy elements – the building blocks of dust – across space.
But supernovae can also destroy dust, and it’s unclear how much survives the trip to interstellar space. By studying Cas A with JWST, astronomers hope to gain a better understanding of its dust content, which can help inform our understanding of where the building blocks of planets – and ourselves – are created.
“In Cas A, we can spatially resolve regions that have different gas compositions and look at what types of dust were formed in those regions,” Temim said.
Carl Sagan famously assured humanity that we are made of “star stuff.” Milisavljevic’s team and JWST’s observations are helping scientist understand that process.
“Webb is an incredible achievement,” Milisavljevic said. “I feel fortunate to be among the first scientists to test its unrivaled power to explore the universe. I am going to spend the rest of my career trying to understand what’s in this data set.”

Air Force initiative at Purdue progresses as it enters second year,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Seventeen projects are under review as year two kicks off for the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Regional Hub Network – Midwest at Purdue University, a program announced last year to use research, science and workforce development of the private sector to speed innovations.
The proposals focus on five technical areas: energetic materials, hypersonics, secure microelectronics, in-space servicing assembly and manufacturing, and space domain awareness. All proposals are from industrial members, academics and government lab partners, said Stacy Manni, deputy director for the Midwest Hub Network. These projects are designed to advance technology while considering scientific, technical, funding and manufacturing needs. Hub leaders will announce the final projects this spring, Manni said.
The Regional Research Hub Network was announced in February 2022 and established two hubs. Purdue leads the Midwest Hub Network, which includes 17 universities and 60 academic, industrial and national laboratory partners throughout 22 Midwest states. Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, leads the hub for the mid-Atlantic region.
“This hub experiment is designed to identify significant ways to move technology solutions from the basic research bench into the application space,” Manni said. “This will bridge a challenging area of research and development.”
The Air Force Research Laboratory established the regional hub networks to bring innovative technologies to market faster through public and private partnerships with large and small businesses, government agencies and venture capitalists; all work is done under cooperative agreements.
Through the regional hub networks, the AFRL can share costs and risks. The hub network also can provide learning opportunities for scientists and engineers and connect AFRL scientists and engineers to the commercial space. If the pilot with Purdue and Cornell is successful, AFRL may stand up other regional hub networks.
Manni came to Purdue from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, where she was senior physical scientist and international program officer. Before that, she was an AFRL research chemist. Given her experience with AFRL, Manni said it is exciting to see this branch of research brought to new entities via the hub setup.
“I love the mission of AFRL, and this is an opportunity to make meaningful advances for the benefit of national security,” she said.
Next for the Midwest Hub Network: selection of the proposals that will go forward. An external review committee of AFRL employees will recommend which of the 17 projects to consider. Meanwhile, networking events are planned at partner universities – the first at University of Akron in Ohio April 6 –and the Midwest Hub Network itself will have an official ribbon-cutting on campus April 21.

‘This Is My Comeback’: Purdue Global launches new brand platform and marketing campaign,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Jacque Yates has a message for working adults everywhere: You’ve got a comeback in you.
Yates, originally from Gary, Indiana, and now living in Texas, speaks from experience. She returned to school 10 years after completing her bachelor’s degree in a traditional college setting.
“With the help of Purdue Global, I was able to come back greater, and for me, greater looks like becoming Dr. Jacque Yates,” said Yates, who earned her Master of Public Health degree in 2021 and delivered the August 2022 Purdue Global commencement address. “That wouldn’t have been a possibility if it wasn’t for my journey here at Purdue Global or the various staff and faculty that embodied the values of seeing me as a whole person. I hope that you are able to be a part of somebody’s comeback story because they’re worth it.”
Purdue University, Indiana’s land-grant university, has operated Purdue Global since 2018, following Purdue’s purchase of Kaplan University. Purdue Global opened access to online education for thousands of working adults who have life experience and some college credits across Indiana, the U.S. and around the world.
Purdue Global officially launched a new brand campaign, “This Is My Comeback,” Monday (April 3), marking the first refreshment of the brand since the university’s formation. The brand campaign is an outward expression of the university’s strengths of being an online university, built for working adults and part of, and backed by, Purdue University. The campaign includes a new visual identity and narrative that will guide Purdue Global’s storytelling, marketing and communication efforts.
The new branding and marketing strategy is the culmination of a yearlong effort following discussions and collaborations between Purdue Global Chancellor Frank Dooley; R. Ethan Braden, executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer for Purdue University and Purdue Global; and Kati Pratt, executive director of brand and marketing strategy for Purdue Marketing and Communications. This group and various stakeholders reviewed the basic question of what it means to be Purdue Global in a crowded online education field.
“Today is a pivotal day in Purdue Global’s history,” Dooley said. “Over the past five years, we have brought more resources, expertise and staff from Purdue West Lafayette to the work we do at Purdue Global. We have emulated what Purdue West Lafayette has done because it was good for both of us, but more importantly, the students we serve.”
Dooley said the rebranding builds on Purdue Global’s strengths and commitment to help working adults by benefiting from the faculty’s practical, real-world experience, which focuses on skills and career outcomes for students.
“It goes back to our name. That first word is Purdue. Both Purdue and Purdue Global offer something to the world,” Dooley said.
Almost 40 million Americans have earned college credit but have not completed a college degree. Dooley said it’s time to transform not just Purdue Global but also online higher education and help those with college credits come back and cross the stage to earn their degrees.
The “comeback” stories are the cornerstones of the Purdue Global campaign, showing the real lives and challenges that working adults face as they look to improve their career trajectory, economic standing and quality of life through an accessible degree from a respected, rigorous and trustworthy online school. Supportive networks built by Purdue Global’s faculty and staff can help determined adults not only attain their goals but, in many instances, provide hope and serve as role models for their children as they go back to school to attain their degree.
Ultimately, according to Braden, it means getting into character and looking for ways to engage and encourage those nearly 40 million adults to come back and earn their degree.
“For 154 years, Purdue, as a land-grant university, has been on a mission to make education accessible for more and more people. That’s a big idea that people can get behind and want to associate with,” Braden said. “It’s in our DNA. Purdue Global is the next frontier of Purdue’s land-grant mission. With it, we can take a trusted education and transcend boundaries — otherwise physical boundaries — using technology to bring a Purdue Global education to anybody who wants it and is willing to earn it.”
Braden also sees a major opportunity to expand the Purdue mission to serve the world through a Purdue-backed online curriculum that is built and designed for working adults.
“We have an incredible master brand, an incredible story, and most importantly, we have incredible faculty and staff who care deeply about changing the world by changing the lives of these students,” Braden said. “Our students say that working on their Purdue Global degree is hard and a lot of work, but it’s worth it. Purdue Global is challenging. It’s true, relevant and legitimate. In a sentence, Purdue Global is about real opportunity for more students.”
As part of the Purdue system, Purdue Global graduates also are eligible for membership in Purdue Alumni Association and other groups associated with Purdue and managed by Purdue for Life Foundation.
Much has changed during the past five years in online education — including a global pandemic that made online education not only accepted but also a requirement in many instances, with more brick-and-mortar higher education institutions offering online classes and degree programs.
Purdue Global leaders have been working with Fortune 500 companies either directly or through partners like Guild to become one of the leading options for employee education benefits, providing access to education programs that foster employee recruitment, training, development, promotion and retention within these companies. Purdue Global also has a deep partnership with Ivy Tech Community College and OneTen.org to address workforce development nationally and across Indiana.
The current student snapshot at Purdue Global includes:
60% of students are 30 years of age or older.
42% of students are underrepresented minorities.
51% of students have a child or other dependents.
Nearly one-third are either in the military or veterans.
50% are first-generation college students.
Purdue Marketing and Communications did extensive research with Purdue Global students, prospective students, student advisors, faculty, alumni and business partners. Three themes emerged from the research: 1) students want a university that will help them prepare for what’s next in their lives and careers, 2) as working adults, they want to feel valued and get credit for what they know and have already done, and 3) they want a degree that they can trust and be proud of — one that is backed by Purdue.
“Purdue Global will prepare students for what’s next,” Pratt said. “Purdue Global is for working adults who bring life experience to the classroom. They are often working adults who have some college credits who want to earn a degree that they can be proud of and that employers will respect.”
Purdue Global is Purdue’s online university for working adults who have life experience and often some college credits. It offers flexible paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, military service and previous college credits, no matter where they are in their life journey. Purdue Global is a nonprofit, public university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and backed by Purdue University. For more information, visit https://stories.purdue.edu/purdue-global/.

Purdue Extension needs your help growing food for science,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Novice and experienced gardeners are invited to join Purdue Extension, the University of Tennessee and Iowa State University for the citizen science experiment Citi-Sci: Growing Food for Science! from April through August.
As scientists, participants will grow six compact tomato plants, bred specifically for urban agriculture in small spaces. Plants will be provided at different stages of maturity to gauge gardener preferences and challenges. Along with provided plants and all other materials needed to conduct the experiment, participants will have access to monthly educational sessions led by representatives from Purdue Extension, University of Tennessee Extension and Iowa State Extension. Session topics will cover pest management, healthy cooking and nutrition, fresh produce handling and food preservation.
“Our citizen science approach focuses on putting comprehensive evaluations in the hand of the consumer,” said Michael Fidler, Purdue horticulture and landscape architecture master’s student and graduate research assistant. “Our research is more than about gardening. We are showing there are smaller vegetable plants that you can grow on your windowsill, balcony or indoors. It’s a way to experience nature, learn about healthy eating, connect with others and be self-sufficient.”
Data collected in the form of two surveys will include yield results, changes in consumer knowledge and plant preferences. These data will be used to share with stakeholders, such as greenhouse growers and breeders, to help the industry understand the needs of home gardeners.
“Our program comes at a time when interest in growing food at home is on the rise,” said Celina Gómez, associate professor of controlled environment agriculture in Purdue’s Department of  Horticulture and Landscape Architecture and Fidler’s advisor. “We’ve seen an increase in requests from novice gardeners asking for information and advice on how to start and maintain vegetable plants in alternative spaces beyond your typical backyard or raised beds. There’s also an increase in availability of plant products that can cater to the urban consumer. Citizen scientists will provide valuable insight to help us understand the necessary tools for them to successfully garden at home.”
The citizen science program is led by Fidler and Gómez.
Interested people living in Lafayette, West Lafayette or Indianapolis can sign up by April 13 online. The experiment is open to anyone, but participants will need a small sunny place to grow their plants. If selected for the research project, participants will receive plant pickup dates, location and more information with additional resources. Contact Gómez at citi-sci@purdue.edu or 765-494-4443 with questions.

"NutraMaize receives $650,000 USDA grant to scale research on orange corn that improves poultry health and egg yolk pigmentation","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
NutraMaize, an agriculture company whose nutritionally enhanced orange corn is currently marketed through a line of premium milled products under the brand Professor Torbert’s Orange Corn, has received a two-year, $650,000 Phase II Small Business Innovation Research grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to demonstrate the health and pigmentation benefits of feeding orange corn to poultry on a commercial scale.
NutraMaize CEO Evan Rocheford said a previous Phase I SBIR grant from the USDA funded proof-of-concept studies that showed NutraMaize Orange Corn improves outcomes in poultry health and egg yolk pigmentation. The results were published in the May 2021 issue and July 2021 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Poultry Science.
“Our previous research shows that when used in poultry feed, NutraMaize Orange Corn has the potential to improve animal welfare, consumer well-being and producer profitability,” Rocheford said. “We’ve shown that it can reduce the incidence and severity of footpad dermatitis, a common health problem for poultry, and significantly enhance the depth of color and health-benefiting antioxidant carotenoid content in egg yolks.”
The goal of the Phase II project, titled “Nutritionally Enhanced Orange Corn: A Natural Domestic Source of Antioxidant Carotenoids for Improved Poultry and Consumer Well-Being,” is to demonstrate that the corn can deliver the health benefits of carotenoids to poultry and consumers on a commercial scale. Carotenoids are natural antioxidant pigments that give many fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, their orange color and health-benefiting reputations.
“In addition to improving poultry health, the carotenoids found in NutraMaize Orange Corn have a number of well-documented health benefits for humans, such as significantly reducing the risk of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of vision loss among older Americans,” Rocheford said. “This means that orange corn has the potential to improve animal welfare and reduce disease-related losses for producers while simultaneously improving consumer well-being by enhancing the nutritional quality of one of America’s most important protein sources – eggs.”
Rocheford said the project has three primary objectives that aim to demonstrate NutraMaize Orange Corn can provide value to the poultry industry at scale:
That it can produce a number of economically relevant health benefits for both broilers and egg layers throughout their production cycles.
That it can enhance the nutritional, visual and functional properties of both poultry meat and eggs.
That it can meet the needs of the poultry industry by being produced efficiently and affordably.
To achieve these objectives, NutraMaize will work with Darrin Karcher, associate professor of animal sciences in Purdue University’s College of Agriculture, and the USDA Agricultural Research Service’s National Poultry Research Center in Athens, Georgia. This team will conduct research studies at Purdue’s Animal Sciences Research and Education Center and partner with grain farmers and commercial poultry producers to conduct field studies.
“We are particularly interested in working with organic egg producers since they have limited options for disease management and typically spend significantly more on expensive carotenoid supplements to ensure their yolks reach the dark color expected by their customers,” Rocheford said. “For organic producers especially, NutraMaize Orange Corn has the opportunity to reduce feed costs, reduce losses associated with disease and deliver a darkly colored egg yolk with enhanced levels of health-benefiting carotenoids. It’s really a win-win-win for the producer, animal and consumer.”
Rocheford said the company is looking for more producers to partner with to conduct commercial trials over the coming years.
“Our mission is to help improve the well-being of as many people and animals as possible,” Rocheford said. “So, we want to talk to every poultry producer, feed mill, grain handler, farmer and seed company who sees the potential value NutraMaize Orange Corn can provide at scale.”

NutraMaize was co-founded by Evan and his father, Torbert Rocheford, the Patterson Endowed Chair and a professor of agronomy in Purdue’s College of Agriculture. More than 20 years ago, Torbert Rocheford started naturally selecting varieties of orange corn to help alleviate malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa as part of an international humanitarian effort called HarvestPlus.
Orange corn is licensed to NutraMaize through the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization. NutraMaize also received guidance from the Purdue Foundry, an entrepreneurship and commercialization hub whose professionals help Purdue innovators create startups. Both are managed by the Purdue Research Foundation.
NutraMaize is a company transforming the United States’ largest staple crop – corn – into a platform for delivering better nutrition on a population-wide scale. NutraMaize’s innovation is a unique variety of naturally selected orange corn. The vibrant orange color comes from significantly higher levels of carotenoids, the same kind of natural antioxidant pigments that give carrots their color and well-known health benefits. Since its founding, NutraMaize has secured over $2 million in SBIR and STTR grants from the National Science Foundation and USDA to bring the benefits of its orange corn to the American public. The company’s antioxidant-rich orange corn is currently available to Americans through its line of premium milled products marketed under the brand Professor Torbert’s Orange Corn.
Purdue Research Foundation is a nonprofit corporation governed by 16 individuals who serve on a board of directors.

"$500,000 grant targets lack of air-quality data in swine production","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A Purdue University team led by Jiqin (JQ) Ni has received a $500,000 grant from the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research to document air-quality issues surrounding pork production in partnership with the National Pork Board.
Particulate matter (PM) at high concentrations can affect the health of both workers and animals, as well as people living and working in neighboring areas. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies PM measuring less than 2.5 and 10 microns (much smaller than the width of a human hair) as the most hazardous. Although the problem is well known, the exact concentrations of such particulate matter within and outside of the swine barns at different times is poorly understood, said Ni, a professor of Agricultural and Biological Engineering.
“We don’t have enough data. One of the issues is the lack of appropriate measurement technology,” Ni said.
Collaborating with Ni on the project are Jae Hong Park, assistant professor in the School of Health Sciences in the College of Health and Human Sciences, and Brian Richert, associate professor of Animal Sciences in the College of Agriculture. Richert specializes in swine nutrition and management and will design the swine barn test environment to operate under a range of controlled conditions and particulate matter concentrations. Park, a certified industrial hygienist, focuses on aerosol science and technology.
“Anything in the air, that’s my target,” said Park, who develops both sensors and samplers. For this project, Park will develop a sensor station that consists of several air-quality sensors.
In addition to particulate matter, swine barns generate gases such as ammonia that may attach to dust. “A swine farm and its surrounding area is a very complex environment,” Park said.
Particulate matter concentrations change greatly with different ventilations and weather conditions. In summer, swine barns increase ventilation rates by operating more fans and opening inlets and curtains. In winter, the barns operate with minimal ventilation to keep pigs warm. These different conditions affect both indoor and outdoor particulate matter concentrations.
These changing concentrations should be monitored and mapped, but the technologies that can do the job are expensive, difficult to operate and slow to produce results.
“There are many commercially available technologies for particulate matter measurement. But none of them are designed for agriculture and livestock use,” Ni said. In the dynamic world of livestock and poultry production, such as swine farms, active animals stir up particulate matter of different sizes and concentrations in the air. Most of the particulate matter will settle quickly, while some will be blown out of the barns through the fans.
“Our objective is to develop a new technology that is low cost, with a faster response and easy to use,” Ni said. After carefully selecting particulate matter sensing units from the commercially available models, his team will develop the needed sensor unit combined with software and a solar power supply.
“In the lab, we can compare these low-cost sensors with the expensive instruments,” Park said. The tests involve collecting dust from the swine barn, then blowing it from a cylinder into a test chamber connected to the sensors.
“That will give us confidence that this new technology will generate accurate concentration measurement data,” Ni said. “We will develop a laboratory system to calibrate our technology to make sure it is compatible with high-end technology. We will also validate the technology in field conditions.”
The first tests will get underway in the controlled environment swine barn at Purdue’s Animal Science Research and Education Center. There, researchers will monitor the concentrations of particulate matter at different locations in rooms that house pigs at all stages of their development, from nursing during lactation to fully grown.
The team also will validate the technology at commercial swine farms in Indiana and Ohio.
“We will have stakeholders closely involved,” Ni said. The new technology will be compared against the commercially available instruments in side-by-side tests at different locations.
“We will measure the PM concentration from the air inside the swine barn, near the exaust fans and  several hundred feet away at different distances from the barn,” he said.
More modifications and improvements to the system will then follow as needed. Once completed, Park said, the work will have potential applications in barns and housing for not only swine but also poultry and other livestock and for handling powders in the food industry.","[{'summary_text': 'a purdue university team has received a $500,000 grant from the foundation for food & agriculture research . the project will document air-quality issues surrounding pork production . swine barns generate gases such as ammonia that may attach to dust .'}]"
Purdue launches oneAPI Center of Excellence to advance AI and HPC teaching in the US,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University will establish a oneAPI Center of Excellence on its West Lafayette campus. Facilitated through Purdue University’s Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the center will take students’ original artificial intelligence and high-performance computing research projects to the next level through teaching oneAPI in the classroom.
oneAPI is an open, multiarchitecture, multivendor programming model for CPUs and accelerator architectures, such as graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays. Based on standards, oneAPI simplifies software development and delivers uncompromised performance for accelerated computing without proprietary lock-in. This is accomplished while enabling the integration of existing code. oneAPI allows developers to choose the best accelerator architecture for the specific problem they are trying to solve without needing to rewrite software for the next architecture and platform.
The oneAPI Center of Excellence is building oneAPI multiarchitecture programming concepts into the ECE curriculum; Purdue faculty will use curated content from Intel, including teaching kits and certified instructor courses. Faculty and students will be provided access to the latest Intel hardware and oneAPI software tools via Intel’s Developer Cloud
“We are very excited to collaborate with Intel on a oneAPI Center of Excellence,” said Milind Kulkarni, associate head of teaching and learning and a professor in electrical and computer engineering. “The Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers a wide variety of classes in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence to students across the College of Engineering and at Purdue. We look forward to offering our students access to top-of-the-line hardware and cutting-edge software and libraries. These resources will give our students the ability to explore the frontiers of what is possible in emerging AI and HPC areas and equip them to become the next generation of leaders across engineering.”
David Inouye, Purdue assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, will teach the pilot course, scheduled to be offered in fall 2023, in which oneAPI curriculum will be incorporated.
“Intel’s Developer Cloud with GPUs can enable students to tackle more realistic and full-scale AI class projects that were previously infeasible,” Inouye said.
“Purdue’s track record as one of the most innovative universities in America with its world-changing research, programs and culture of inclusion is a perfect fit for the oneAPI Center of Excellence,” said Scott Apeland, senior director of Intel Developer Relations. “By giving Purdue students access to the latest AI software and hardware, we’ll see the next generation of developers, scientists and engineers delivering innovations that will change the world. We’re excited to assist Purdue in embracing the next giant leap in accelerated computing.”
The collaboration also will connect Purdue students and researchers with Intel engineers, providing opportunities to discuss new innovations and developments in accelerator research, said Timothy Rogers, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and the Purdue-Intel liaison.
“We are excited about the opportunities this collaboration opens up as both parties explore how to program and design the accelerators of tomorrow,” Rogers said.

Purdue receives $20 million commitment from alum Sassola for new pharmacy leadership academy,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue University College of Pharmacy has received a $20 million commitment from alumnus Marcel Sassola III to establish a new leadership academy that will expand the college’s offerings and prepare a new pipeline of pharmacy graduates to innovate and lead in an ever-changing health care landscape.
The Marcel Sassola III Leaders and Entrepreneurs Advancing Pharmacy (LEAP) Academy will be modeled after the successful Larsen Leaders Academy in the university’s Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business, and will focus on strengthening leadership and entrepreneurship among Purdue pharmacy students.
“I felt now was the time to give back and, ultimately, pay my success forward by giving other people the same opportunities I had – or even better,” Sassola (BS Pharm ’83) said. “Purdue and education have both always been passions of mine. I wanted to make sure my gifts would have the biggest possible impact on the university, and this was the right moment.”
The LEAP Academy will feature a LEAP Scholars program for undergraduate, PharmD and PhD students. Students selected as LEAP Scholars will be chosen based on student leadership activities, academic record and a rigorous selection process. Scholars are responsible for:
Participating in the Pharmacy Leadership and Innovation Forum class.
Completing the Purdue Entrepreneurship and Innovation Certificate Program.
Executing special projects and challenges designed to contribute value to the College of Pharmacy’s programs and services.
Maintaining good standing in both academic performance and professional conduct.
Attending two weekend events – including an off-campus leadership and entrepreneurship retreat during the fall and an on-campus retreat during the spring – that will feature “Shark Tank”-like presentations.
The LEAP Scholars Academy will be coordinated by the LEAP Academy program director, which is a new position, and counseled by an alumni entrepreneurship advisory board.
“The College of Pharmacy has a proven legacy of transforming the practice and science of pharmacy to lead advances in human health and of developing graduates who display a broad range of expertise that extends to areas such as management, economics and public health,” said Eric L. Barker, the Jeannie and Jim Chaney Dean of the College of Pharmacy and professor of medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacy. “Through Marcel Sassola’s generosity, we will be able to build on that rich tradition and provide our students with all the tools they need to succeed as leaders and pioneers in the industry.”
Sassola is the former CEO of Santa Barbara Specialty Pharmacy, which services California and five nearby states, and has more than 35 years of experience as a pharmacist and entrepreneur. He is a member of the Purdue Alumni Association and President’s Council and also is active in the Santa Barbara and Los Angeles communities.
“Purdue helped me build a foundation of education and simultaneously provided me the ability to learn more about who I was and what I wanted to do with my life. Giving back now makes me feel like I’ve found a missing piece,” Sassola said. “I look forward to meeting the first LEAP Scholars, serving as a steward for this exciting new program and witnessing the evolution of the College of Pharmacy.”
Matt Folk, president and CEO of the Purdue for Life Foundation and vice president for university advancement and alumni engagement, said, “With all the giant leaps occurring right now at Purdue, this is a critical time for the university and its future. This gift from Marcel Sassola is a shining example of how our alumni continue to step up in support of Purdue, its mission and its direction moving forward.”

Connected vehicles the latest tool to give engineers real-time insight into highway traffic congestion issues,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University researchers have developed techniques to harness big data from connected vehicles to monitor congestion caused by crashes, weather and construction. As part of their work, they analyzed over 503 billion records in December 2022 to monitor the national impact of a large winter storm.
The team is led by Darcy Bullock, the Lyles Family Professor of Civil Engineering in Purdue’s Lyles School of Civil Engineering, and focuses on developing scalable techniques for measuring and graphically visualizing traffic congestion.
For many years, the U.S. Department of Transportation, universities and private sector companies have published annual congestion reports and rankings of states and cities. However, Bullock believes the new frontier is to develop techniques that use connected vehicle data to map out the time, location and severity of congestion in a uniform manner across all 50 states. This will provide a more robust systemwide characterization of interstate congestion to prioritize national infrastructure investments as well as monitor the resiliency of our network during large weather events such as winter storms or hurricanes.
“There are three key ingredients in this analysis: data, cloud platforms and graphic visualization methods. The combination enables decision makers to quickly understand how traffic is moving,” said Howell Li, principal research analyst, who has worked with Wejo Data Services Inc. to analyze the data systematically in real time using Google’s BigQuery. “On a typical Friday afternoon, Purdue ingests approximately 600,000 records per minute on just Indiana roads. At a national level, there are over 25 million connected vehicle records generated every minute.”
Transportation research engineers Jairaj Desai and Jijo Mathew and PhD candidate Rahul Sakhare have developed analytical techniques for processing that data in real time to create graphical maps showing week-at-a-glance charts depicting the time, location and severity of traffic congestion. These same techniques could also be used to show how usage of electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles varied by states and interstate routes.
“Privacy is very important for all of our public and private sector partners,” Bullock said. “Our connected vehicle data provider employs consented, deidentified and anonymized data that is consistent with both U.S. and EU general data protection regulations.”
The Purdue team produced two major reports in 2022, one for August and the other for December. Although both reports used similar analysis techniques, the August report is a great tool to see the impact of construction work zones on mobility. The December report provides an example of the impact of a large winter storm moving across the U.S. and the subsequent state-by-state recovery. A video illustrating the national impact of that storm on I-80 can be seen at https://youtu.be/YrYz9CovAuA. State-by-state impact on all interstate routes can be found at https://doi.org/10.5703/1288284317591.
“From a national perspective, this is really valuable,” Bullock said. “Data like this can show us our overall interstate network resiliency as well as provide insights to support operational decisions and long-term national infrastructure investments.”

"Colorful sidewalks move tourists, Purdue HTM researchers discover","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.  —
A team of Purdue University researchers in the White Lodging-J.W. Marriott, Jr. School of Hospitality and Tourism Management and College of Engineering investigated whether Americans were willing to put on their walking shoes to take in the sights and sounds at an urban tourist destination.
In the study, led by HTM PhD student Jun Chen and professor Xinran Lehto, the researchers surveyed almost 2,000 U.S. adults to understand if colorful sidewalks, images of people moving and even just the image of walking shoes would entice vacationers to skip Uber and hoof it themselves. Mark Lehto, Purdue professor of industrial engineering, also participated in the project.
The research, published in the April 2023 Tourism Management journal, found those polled would be more apt to walk around the city if the paths leading them to a museum or historic site were clearly marked and decorated. The images of people walking or merely of sneakers were encouraging as well, whether they were posted near the paths or in hotels, the project also found.
More information can be read on the Purdue University School of Hospitality and Tourism website.

Boilermaker Vegetable Season Pass returns for 2023,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue Student Farm will provide fresh, locally grown vegetables to community members this summer and fall through the Boilermaker Vegetable Season Pass, now in its fourth year.
The community-supported agriculture program provides an educational experience for students as well as weekly bags of fresh vegetables and herbs for community participants.
“We get the opportunity to apply sustainable agricultural practices and experience the delicious results,” says Wil Brown-Grimm, an undergraduate in sustainable food and farming systems. “The CSA program gives a sense of gratification because we’re able to directly interact with those who enjoy our produce.”
Day-to-day farm operations are managed by several student groups: those enrolled in the Small Farms Experience courses, volunteers involved in the Purdue Student Farm Organization, part-time undergraduate interns and full-time undergraduate summer interns.
Boilermaker Vegetable Season Pass began as a pivot after pandemic-related issues led to the temporary closure of Purdue’s student dining halls, the primary customers for the Student Farm. After the dining halls reopened, the Student Farm prioritized the program and has continued to provide produce to members each season.
“I really enjoy running the CSA program,” says Chris Adair, Purdue Student Farm manager. “It provides fresh produce to the local community while also supporting the students as they grow and learn throughout the season.”
Aaron Thompson, associate professor of landscape architecture, said, “As a family, we look forward to weekly pickups at the Student Farm – everyone gets involved in sorting, tasting and preparing a wide range of foods each week. The assortment in the box provides us with our usual staples while encouraging us to try new fruits and vegetables. We couldn’t be happier with the service, experience and opportunity to support the Student Farm.”

"Ericsson, Saab and Purdue University announce ‘lab to life’ innovative 5G network to make Purdue Airport accessible as a real-life research site for aviation industry","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University Airport, in collaboration with industry partners Ericsson and Saab, announced Monday (March 20) the creation of a unique 5G network that will serve as a “lab to life” proving ground for academics, researchers and business to develop commercial solutions that can be replicated to improve operations and security at airports of all sizes. 5G innovation has promised to provide a new generation of capabilities for enterprises. This project aims to bring to life the benefits of private 5G for airports, where new high-performance networks can be tested in real-life scenarios.
In today’s environment, airports install sensors and systems that require hardwired network connections, often requiring physical connection points via trenches for copper lines or fiber-optic cables. Alternatively, airports can consider point-to-point radio frequency links, which are often unreliable, or public cellular connections that come with subscription fees and consumer-oriented performance limitations. The collaboration among Purdue University, Ericsson and Saab at Purdue Airport makes this approach obsolete. With the technology exhibited at Purdue, airports will find they have more flexibility to add or relocate products when the airport goes through construction phases, saving time and resources for operators and consumers.
Ericsson, one of the leading providers of information and communication technology to service providers across the globe, will contribute a private 5G network for the Purdue Research Foundation to operate at the Purdue University Airport (LAF). LAF is Purdue University’s public-use airport, which is located in the southwest portion of the West Lafayette campus. It conducts over 125,000 aircraft operations annually, making it Indiana’s second-busiest airport.
Saab will invest in this project by installing Aerobahn™, a platform that unlocks airport efficiency for airlines and ramp management; installing SAFE Event Management platforms, a security platform used in airport operation centers; and deploying ADS-B sensors to track aircraft. These investments will improve landside operational safety and efficiency, as well as improve airside security.
Purdue will provide use of its airport as well as the lab to life testbed established throughout Discovery Park District at Purdue, a 400-acre, mixed-use development adjacent to the university’s campus.
“Purdue University is the perfect location for this project to innovate airport management,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “Purdue has established longstanding partnerships with Ericsson and Saab, two Swedish innovators and global tech leaders. Purdue University Airport is one of the handful of airports operated at a research university in the U.S. And Purdue’s Discovery Park District, next to our airport, has provided a lab to life ecosystem where cutting-edge technologies are deployed before any other locations in the country. No other location is better suited for these exciting 5G innovations and network management solutions that will impact people’s lives around the globe.”
Troy Hege, vice president of innovation and technology for Purdue Research Foundation, which manages Discovery Park District at Purdue, said, “Expanding the lab to life platform to the Purdue Airport creates great opportunities to advance aviation and mobility innovation and education in partnership with industry, faculty and students. The combination of Purdue’s operational airport, research faculty and students with Ericsson’s Private 5G network and Saab’s sensor arrays and operating systems is an innovation and education asset that is unlike anything else that exists today.”
Ericsson Private 5G is a 4G and 5G dual-mode core private network tailored to drive the digital transformation across a broad set of industries and enterprises. Ericsson Private 5G is a high-performance, easy-to-use, cellular connectivity solution built to power innovation for Industry 4.0.
“We are witnessing uptake in global demand for digitalization at airports that requires stable, secure and high-performing wireless networking. Ericsson’s Private 5G network will enable cellular connectivity for the lab to life innovation platform at the Purdue University Airport,” said George Mulhern, head of Ericsson Enterprise Wireless Solutions. “This unique collaboration enables trials and industrialization of 5G applications and use cases that help solve aviation market needs – improving flight safety, enhanced passenger experience, as well as increased efficiencies and cost savings. This is just one more example of how different enterprises can work with 5G networks to develop solutions in real-world environments.”
Adam Baxmeyer, Purdue Airport manager, sees the private 5G installation as a strong fit with the airport’s vision.
“Purdue Airport has proven to be a key location in Indiana to aid commercial and industrial consumers. We have built a sterling reputation through more than 90 years of service,” Baxmeyer said. “Our mission also extends to Purdue students, faculty and staff who hone skills, conduct research and improve upon today’s aviation and transportation technology. This collaboration is a natural fit for Purdue Airport as it enables us to study and better understand technologies that will be fundamental to airports of the future.”
Saab will be the first industry partner to use this dedicated 5G network. Saab, a global defense and security company, opened an advanced manufacturing facility in Discovery Park District at Purdue in 2021. That state-of-the-art facility supports production of the T-7A Red Hawk, which will train the next generation of U.S. Air Force fighter and bomber pilots for decades to come.
“This platform is intended to showcase how state-of-the-art airport systems can work with 5G technology,” said Erik Smith, president and CEO of Saab in the U.S. “By combining airside and landside operations to improve airport efficiency and planning, the platform at Purdue will help us continue that journey. Investing together with Ericsson at Purdue is a no-brainer and a win-win for Indiana. We’re proud to be a part of this innovative 5G project, leveraging our longstanding track record of excellence in air traffic control to deliver a solution that will be replicable across other platforms.”
David Rosenberg, Indiana Economic Development Corp. chief operating officer and chief of staff, said, “The state applauds the thought leadership of Ericsson, Saab and Purdue in establishing this collaboration. This type of impactful project between two global industry leaders and an internationally renowned research university all based here in Indiana is what we had hoped for when the state made 5G development a top priority. It is fulfilling to see this collaboration and its commercial results alongside other 5G projects in Indiana.”

Purdue offering online Prequalified Structures for the Stage course,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
For theater lovers, there is a kind of magic to watching a play come to life on stage. Good stage productions transport audience members into the story, making them momentarily forget their lives outside of the theater.
But making productions come to life takes a lot of work – set elements, for example, require months of careful planning and construction. Safe and effective set construction is often the literal foundation behind a production’s ultimate success, as well as the safety and well-being of its actors. The secret behind safe set construction? Smart engineering.
“The number of online videos documenting stage collapses is frightening,” said Rich Dionne, associate professor of practice and faculty technical director for Purdue’s Fusion Studio for Entertainment and Engineering. “Wanting to build a raised platform and knowing how to do it safely are two different things, and being able to confidently determine how best to construct platforms ensures the safety and well-being of all involved in a production.”
Purdue’s new online course Prequalified Structures for the Stage, offered by the Fusion Studio for Entertainment and Engineering, explains the engineering principles behind effective and safe theater set construction. The five-week course covers topics such as understanding loads on platforms, structural considerations, sheet goods, stick lumber, framing, legs and supports, 2-by-4-framed platforms and stressed-skin panels, and pre-manufactured platforming – essential components of theater set construction.
The course is taught asynchronously, meaning students can access course materials at any time and work on a flexible schedule. The course’s online modality makes it an ideal upskilling opportunity for professionals who already work in the theater and performing arts industries and are seeking a new qualification that can be earned in their free time.
“Some of the folks who most want this knowledge are busy doing the work, and finding time to gain new knowledge can be challenging,” Dionne said. “You can complete the materials in this course at your own pace—at 2 in the morning in your pajamas, or on a break during a load-in – however you can fit it into your schedule.”
Dionne, the course’s instructor, has decades of experience working in the theater industry as a scenery automation and show control systems specialist. At Purdue, he mentors engineering students concentrating in theater engineering and has served as the technical director for many Purdue Theater productions.
Before joining the faculty at Purdue, Dionne was the production manager and sound designer at the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey. He is passionate about both the art of theater and the engineering behind a production’s success, and he brings those joint passions into the classroom.
“This course takes an approach that foregrounds the principles involved and minimizes mathematical analysis,” Dionne said. “The intent is to provide a basis for understanding how various stage structures work—useful knowledge for anyone in this industry, from directors to set designers, stagehands to technical directors.”
Though much of the information in the course is based on engineering principles, the course is accessible to beginners and open to the public. High school and college theater educators, theater managers, stage managers, directors, performing artists, venue owners and anyone else interested in learning more about set construction is welcome to enroll.

How the NCAA tournament impacts host cities – new video uploaded to AP Video Hub,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A video featuring Ben Van Kammen, a senior lecturer of economics in the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business at Purdue University, has been uploaded to the AP Video Hub. In the video, Van Kammen explains how large sporting events, such as the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, impact the economy of host cities. This video can be found at https://apvideohub.ap.org/detail/HowtheNCAAtournamentimpactshostcities/8f6f1943f34249fcb3deb3190b322b87.

AP members may use the video or pull quotes for print articles, broadcasts or podcasts.
Ben Van Kammen, a senior lecturer of economics in the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business at Purdue University, says cities hosting large sporting events essentially see a diversion or reallocation of economic activity closer to where the event is taking place. He says there is no evidence that such events result in significant additional economic activity to cities. Foot traffic and spending may increase around the stadium, he says, but this activity comes from activities that people aren’t doing in other parts of the city. Additionally, residents may avoid crowded downtown areas and choose to spend their time and money elsewhere while the event is ongoing.","[{'summary_text': 'a video featuring a senior lecturer of economics at the Mitchell E.

Purdue’s ‘world’s whitest paint’ wins 2023 SXSW Innovation Award,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The world’s whitest paint, developed by Purdue University researchers and recognized in Guinness World Records, has been named winner of the 2023 Innovation Award in the sustainability category by South by Southwest Conference & Festivals (SXSW).
The award “recognizes the most exciting creative developments in the connected world,” and was presented to Purdue on Monday (March 13) at the 25th annual SXSW Innovation Awards Ceremony in Austin, Texas. Purdue was chosen in the sustainability category from among four finalists that included Purdue; Indianapolis-based Atarraya: Sustainable Shrimp-Farming Tech; The Trees of the Future, based in Hayward, California; and Chicago-based Natures Fynd: Fy Protein.
The paint, developed by Purdue professor of mechanical engineering Xiulin Ruan, is fighting global warming by keeping surfaces cool enough to reduce the need for internal air conditioning. SXSW is the latest to recognize the innovation, which was previously featured on PBS NewsHour and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. Earlier this month, the paint was named winner of the 2023 Gizmodo Science Fair.
In 2022 Ruan and his team innovated further by developing a new formulation of his groundbreaking paint that is now thinner and lighter – ideal for radiating heat away from cars, trains, airplanes and even spacecraft. According to Ruan and his team’s models, covering 1% of the Earth’s surface in their technology could mitigate the total effects of global warming, a fact encouraging them to continue pursuing formulas suitable for surfaces like asphalt and roadways (podcast available online).
“With this award, we are honored that SXSW joins a growing list of organizations, publications, and states that recognize Purdue University and its world-changing researchers are delivering practical solutions to today’s toughest challenges,” said R. Ethan Braden, executive vice president, chief marketing and communications officer for Purdue University and Purdue Global. “Whether it’s the world’s whitest paint to combat global warming or the workforce needed to onshore semiconductor production in the United States, Boilermakers are delivering innovative giant leaps again and again.”
Typical commercial white paint gets warmer rather than cooler when subjected to sunlight or other light sources. Paints on the market that are designed to reject heat reflect only 80% to 90% of sunlight and can’t make surfaces cooler than their surroundings.
In comparison, the world’s whitest paint reflects 98.1% of solar heat away from its surface.
Because the paint absorbs less heat from the sun than it emits, a surface coated with this paint is cooled below the surrounding temperature without consuming power.
Using this formulation to cover a roof area of about 1,000 square feet could result in a cooling power of 10 kilowatts, more powerful than the air conditioners used by most houses. At SXSW, researchers demonstrated the effects of the difference with two model barns sitting under direct halogen lights: one painted in commercial paint and one in Purdue’s white paint. Judges were able to compare thermometers reading the barns’ internal temperatures and to feel the difference in the roofs. The barn painted in Purdue’s technology consistently held cooler internal temperatures by 8-10 degrees Fahrenheit. The “whitest white” barn roof was also much cooler to the touch, prompting many surprised responses from judges and viewers.
While Ruan’s original paint formula is massively efficient, it required a layer 0.4 millimeters thick to achieve subambient radiant cooling. The newer, thinner formulation can achieve similar cooling with a layer just 0.15 millimeters thick.
The new paint also incorporates voids of air, which make it highly porous. This lower density, together with the thinness, provides another huge benefit: reduced weight. The newer paint weighs 80% less than the original paint yet achieves nearly identical solar reflectance – 97.9%, compared to the original formula’s 98.1%.
Ruan and his team of researchers are currently working with the Purdue Research Foundation’s Office of Technology Commercialization for commercialization.  According to Ruan, “We are in discussions right now to commercialize it. There are still a few issues that need to be addressed, but progress is being made.”
Ruan says the cost and production process is expected to be similar to commercial paint, which they’ve kept in mind from the beginning so that it would be accessible when it’s ready for market.
Patent applications for this paint formulation have been filed through the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization. For further discussion on this intellectual property, contact whitepaint@prf.org and reference code 2022-RUAN-69542. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation with Award No. 2102645, and Andrea Felicelli was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. The research was performed at Purdue’s FLEX Lab and Ray W. Herrick Laboratories and the Birck Nanotechnology Center of Discovery Park District at Purdue.

"Purdue, Varcity partner for new alumni-focused residential development in Discovery Park District","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University, the Purdue Research Foundation, the Purdue for Life Foundation and Varcity have reached an agreement to establish a wellness-infused residential development in Discovery Park District at Purdue.
Varcity, a McNair Living brand, builds developments directly affiliated with universities through business and social programming. The company collaborates with higher-education institutions to provide residential living to alumni and community members in state-of-the-art, amenity-rich communities located on or near campuses. Typically, Varcity developments include:
One-, two-, and three-bedroom homes and freestanding villas.
Concierge service.
Multiple chef-inspired restaurants.
Lifelong learning opportunities.
Interior design that celebrates the institution’s history.
Dedicated health and wellness support for Varcity residents that includes telehealth and telemedicine, physical therapy facilities, assisted-living options and more.
Due to its official affiliation with the university, Varcity at Purdue will feature elements customized for the community:
Location in the heart of a vibrant on-campus, mixed-use neighborhood.
Ground floor specifically designed for interaction with students, faculty and the larger community, including space for group meetings, art exhibitions, intergenerational engagement and more.
Early childhood education center.
Expansive green spaces and professional-grade pickleball courts.
On-site lifelong learning center through a partnership with the Purdue for Life Foundation.
Purdue ID cards for all residents with access to university facilities.

The Varcity development will sit over ground floor amenities that are available to everyone on campus. The villas, townhomes and apartment living options are projected to be home to residents in their mid-60s to mid-80s with wellness services available for any need at any age.
“We’ve been very intentional on creating a robust, well-rounded community through the Discovery Park District development, and this partnership with Varcity provides us with another cornerstone element,” said Emily Najem, vice president of economic development and corporate counsel for the Purdue Research Foundation. “The district is a central connector for research, academia and corporate America — we’re building an innovative community where everyone wants to live.”
While exploring how this new development could best be integrated into the Purdue community, Varcity representatives met with numerous university deans and conducted focus groups with students, faculty and alumni. The goal is to use focus-group feedback to establish a community designed for multiple generations of Boilermakers and the Greater Lafayette community.
“It’s been our pleasure to work alongside Purdue to bring this development to life,” said Ryan Haller, managing principal with Varcity. “Since our first meeting with university officials, it’s been clear Purdue is a unique institution in its business-friendly approach. While all our partners are special to us, Purdue was the first institution to buy into our entrepreneurial vision and continues to be the gold standard of public-private partnerships in higher education.”
Varcity will also engage students through experiential learning, both during construction and after residents are living in the development.
“This development will offer important opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to work with, learn from and possibly even live alongside older adults,” said Marion Underwood, dean of the College of Health and Human Sciences, Distinguished Professor of Psychological Sciences and lead author of a proposal about understanding and enhancing vital longevity that ultimately led to the partnership with Varcity. “I’m especially excited about the experiences that our HHS students will have, including internships and clinical practicum opportunities in nursing, dietetics, athletic training, audiology, hospitality and tourism management and other disciplines.”
Genell Ebbini, assistant professor of interior design, said, “Purdue interior design students will be true partners in the design of the facility, working alongside professionals. This is not theory — it is experiential learning at its best, where students can walk over, see the building and work hands-on. We hope to include students from many schools and majors at different stages of development.”
This agreement represents the university’s latest effort to grow Discovery Park District at Purdue, a 400-acre, mixed-use development at the edge of campus that is quickly transforming the face of Purdue. Among its cutting-edge research facilities and commercial developments, district plans already include:
Provenance: A walkable, dynamic community of townhomes, apartments and single-family homes with amenities that include a clubhouse, nature trails and restaurants.
Continuum: A mixed-use development that features 246 luxury one- and two-bedroom apartments, as well as 15,000 square feet of street-level commercial space.
Aspire: An 835-bed apartment complex designed primarily for students.
Convergence: A 145,000-square-foot, five-story, mixed-use building designed to support innovation, collaboration and private-industry growth.
Ascension St. Vincent: A neighborhood hospital for inpatient and emergency care.
Squirrel Park: A new green space featuring a 1938 horse barn repurposed as an event venue and potential brewery, donated by the Sonny Beck Family.
Source: A community of luxury two- and three-bedroom condominiums designed for both work and play.
“More than 75 universities have a senior living affiliation, but none are integrated with the campus community the way Varcity will be at Purdue,” said Matt Folk, president and CEO of the Purdue for Life Foundation and vice president for university advancement and alumni engagement at Purdue. “We want to provide our alumni with the perfect destination to live, work, play and retire, and this partnership will help set the Discovery Park District apart.”

‘Talking’ concrete could help prevent traffic jams and cut carbon emissions,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
An increasing number of U.S. interstates are set to try out a Purdue University invention that could save millions of taxpayer dollars and significantly reduce traffic delays.
The invention, a sensor that allows concrete to “talk,” decreases construction time and how often concrete pavement needs repairs while also improving the road’s sustainability and cutting its carbon footprint.
Embedded directly into a concrete pour, the sensor sends engineers more precise and consistent data about the concrete’s strength and need for repair than is possible with currently used tools and methods.
“Traffic jams caused by infrastructure repairs have wasted 4 billion hours and 3 billion gallons of gas on a yearly basis. This is primarily due to insufficient knowledge and understanding of concrete’s strength levels,” said Luna Lu, the Reilly Professor and acting head of Purdue’s Lyles School of Civil Engineering, who has been leading development of the sensors since 2017. “For instance, we don’t know when concrete will reach the right strength needed to accommodate traffic loads just after construction. The concrete may go through premature failure, leading to frequent repairing.”
According to data from the Federal Highway Administration, concrete pavement makes up less than 2% of U.S. roads but approximately 20% of the U.S. interstate system. Lu’s research has focused on improving the conditions of concrete pavement first because it is the most challenging road material to repair. Concrete interstate pavement also must reliably support a large proportion of the nation’s traffic.
More than half of U.S. states with concrete interstate pavement have signed up to participate in a Federal Highway Administration pooled fund study to implement the sensors. The participating states are Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Kansas, California, Texas, Tennessee, Colorado and Utah.
Additional states are expected to join as the study kicks off in the coming months. Two states – Indiana and Texas – have already begun trying out the sensors in highway paving projects.
The technology also is on track to hit the market later this year as the REBEL Concrete Strength Sensing System, a product of WaveLogix. Lu founded WaveLogix in 2021 to manufacture the technology on a larger scale. The company licenses the technology from the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for patent protection on the intellectual property.
Fast Company magazine named this invention one of its Next Big Things in Tech for 2022, which recognizes projects already making an impact on a real-world problem while also showing promise to make a greater impact in the years to come. The American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2021 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure also selected the technology as one of its “Gamechangers” for the year. Other organizations, such as the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, have followed the technology’s developments since its initial introduction in 2019.
The Purdue invention is gradually rising as a better alternative to tests that have been the industry’s standard since the early 1900s.
Lu and her lab started developing the technology in 2017, when the Indiana Department of Transportation requested help in eliminating premature failure of newly repaired concrete pavement by more accurately determining when the pavement is ready to be opened to traffic.
After embedding an early prototype of the sensor into sections of various Indiana highways, INDOT added the sensor technology to its Indiana Test Methods Index. This index lists tests for contractors and construction workers to use to ensure road pavement quality.
Methods that the industry has used for more than a century call for testing large samples of concrete at a lab or onsite facility. Using that data, engineers estimate the strength level that a particular concrete mix will reach after it’s been poured and left to mature at a construction site. Even though these tests are well understood by the industry, discrepancies between lab and outdoor conditions can lead to inaccurate estimates of the concrete’s strength due to the different cement compositions and temperatures of the surrounding area.
With the technology Lu and her team invented, engineers no longer have to rely on concrete samples to estimate when fresh concrete is mature enough. Instead, they can directly monitor the fresh concrete and accurately measure many of its properties at once.
The sensor communicates to engineers via a smartphone app exactly when the pavement is strong enough to handle heavy traffic. The stronger the pavement is before being used by vehicles, the less often it will need to be repaired. The ability to instantly receive information about the concrete’s strength levels also allows roads to open to traffic on time or sooner following a fresh pour.Construction workers can install the sensors simply by tossing them onto the ground of the concrete formwork and covering them with concrete. Next, they plug the sensor cable into a reusable handheld device that automatically starts logging data. Using the app, workers can receive information on real-time changes in the concrete strength for as long as the strength data is required.

By decreasing road repairs and construction timelines, this technology could reduce carbon dioxide that vehicles would have emitted while waiting in traffic to get around a construction site.
By decreasing road repairs and construction timelines, this technology could reduce carbon dioxide that vehicles would have emitted while waiting in traffic to get around a construction site.
Lu’s startup, WaveLogix, also is developing a way to curb carbon emissions by cutting the amount of cement needed in concrete mixes. The manufacturing of cement is responsible for 8% of the world’s carbon footprint. WaveLogix has made progress on a solution that uses artificial intelligence to optimize the design of concrete mixes based on data that the sensors would collect from highways across the country.
Construction codes call for a higher cement content in concrete mixes to ensure that concrete sample testing meets required strength thresholds. Excess cement can lead to premature cracks in pavement. Based on these code requirements and data from the Global Cement and Concrete Association, Lu estimates that concrete mix overdesign causes more than 1 billion tons of carbon emissions per year.
“The biggest problem with concrete mixes is that we use more cement to increase the concrete’s strength. That won’t help open the road to traffic any sooner,” Lu said.
These codes are based on how concrete mixes were made in the early 1900s, which was before equipment that could grind cement into finer powder was developed in the 1950s. Since concrete mixes use that finer powder today, they should have different water-cement ratios than a hundred years ago. The codes also don’t take into consideration how weather in different states impacts a concrete mix. A concrete pour in the middle of Indiana’s winter, for example, requires different concrete mixes to reach the right strength level than if the concrete were poured during California’s winter.
Lu believes that this new method using artificial intelligence could potentially reduce by 20% to 25% the amount of the cement used in concrete mixes – and simultaneously make pavement more durable and less expensive.
“I feel a strong sense of responsibility to make an impact on our infrastructure through developing new types of technology. In the field of civil engineering, if we don’t make an impact on the world, there won’t be a world to worry about,” Lu said.

"PurdueALERT test, campuswide tornado drill on Tuesday (March 14)","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University’s Emergency Preparedness and Planning department will conduct a test of the PurdueALERT system at 10:15 a.m. Tuesday (March 14). At the same time, the campus community is invited to participate in a voluntary tornado drill.
The test of the university’s emergency notification system PurdueALERT is part of the National Weather Service’s “Severe Weather Preparedness Week in Indiana (March 12-18),” as designated by Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb. The National Weather Service, in conjunction with statewide agencies, will test communication systems around the state.
As part of Purdue’s test, PurdueALERT will be activated at 10:15 a.m. Tuesday. Notifications will be released through email, text messaging and Twitter (@purdueemergency), and posted on the WL Campus Emergency Status webpage. Additionally, the All-Hazards Outdoor Sirens, Alertus beacons installed in large classrooms, desktop pop-up alerts on most classroom and lab computers, digital signs and the Boiler TV emergency alert systems will be activated. The test will be postponed to Wednesday (March 15) if weather conditions warrant.
To participate in the voluntary tornado drill, campus building deputies and other building leaders are encouraged to practice and test their building emergency plans by organizing a shelter-in-place drill. Such a drill is designed to ensure that building occupants know what to do in an emergency and confirm that there is adequate space in designated shelter-in-place locations. This also provides an opportunity to test the functionality of weather radios, computers and other communication devices. The voluntary tornado drill exercise plan can be found on the Emergency Preparedness and Planning website.
Purdue is located in the county with the highest number of reported tornado touchdowns in the state, so even if a tornado warning shelter-in-place drill is not possible, building occupants should take a few minutes to review their building emergency plan. They should also familiarize themselves with their building’s shelter-in-place locations and review the tornadoes and thunderstorm procedures online.

Purdue engineers create safer solid-state lithium-ion batteries from new composite materials,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University engineers are making one of the most-used power sources safer and more efficient.
High-voltage, solid-state lithium-ion batteries are the­ go-to power source for high-end technologies like electric and hybrid vehicles, wearable devices, pacemakers, radio-frequency identification systems and more. One of their most dramatic drawbacks is that they often explode when damaged.
A team led by Vilas Pol, a Purdue professor in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering, has developed a new composite material that is safer to use in those batteries than traditional solid polymer electrolyte, or SPE, technologies.
Pol’s new, patent-pending composite material improves upon traditional SPE materials in several ways:
It has a wide voltage window of around 4.8 volts.
It has an optimized ionic conductivity of around 2.4*10^4 microsiemens.
It shows excellent thermal stability up to around 330 degrees Celsius.
It exhibits stability to cell damage, leading to a huge increase in safety.
Pol said traditional SPE materials have other drawbacks.
“They have poor thermal stability, which can cause battery thermal runaway and lead to catastrophic firing,” Pol said. “Their ionic conductivity is limited to low temperatures, which can reduce energy efficiency and lifetime. And low-energy-density batteries can cause quick energy depletion and short operating times of devices, considering the limited space for a battery in electronics or electric vehicles.
“We have further developed advanced electrolytes with fire-retardant molecules as a quasi-solid-state battery, enhancing the lithium-ion battery safety.”
Pol and his team have continued their research to make the material even safer via electrolyte composite optimization, battery overcharging, and nail penetration and thermal abuse testing.
Pol’s research has been published in the November 2020 and July 2021 issues of the peer-reviewed Chemical Engineering Journal. He disclosed the innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent on the intellectual property. Industry partners seeking to further develop this innovation should contact William Buchanan, wdbuchanan@prf.org, about reference numbers 2020-POL-68955 and 2023-POL-69972.
Pol’s work on the new composite material has been funded by the Office of Naval Research and Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization’s Trask Innovation Fund.

Americans planning frugal uses for their 2023 tax refunds,"summarize:Info for journalists
Americans likely are receiving smaller tax refunds than they have in recent years, and most people will not be going out to spend this money, according to the February 2023 Consumer Food Insights Report. This month’s report also looks more closely at religious demographics and includes new data on frozen food preferences.
The survey-based report out of Purdue University’s Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability assesses food spending, consumer satisfaction and values, support of agricultural and food policies, and trust in information sources. Purdue experts conducted and evaluated the survey, which included 1,200 consumers across the U.S.
“Of those who will be spending their tax refunds, improving food purchases is top of mind, which suggests that refunds are a part of reinforcing some households’ food situation,” said Jayson Lusk, the head and Distinguished Professor of Agricultural Economics at Purdue, who leads the center. Americans expect to receive a tax refund of $1,940, on average. They plan to use most of it for savings, for investment or to reduce debt.
“There seems to be some optimism about food inflation improving, but consumers are not willing or able to spend more on food than they are currently,” Lusk said. “I would also not expect food spending to start falling unless economic conditions worsen, which is a real possibility.”
This month’s report highlights the role that frozen foods play in many consumer diets. Frozen vegetables are the most common item that people select from the freezer aisle. It appears that price is a key part of that decision, Lusk noted.
More than 60% of surveyed consumers assess fresh food as somewhat better or much better nutritionally than frozen food. “For most foods, the science does not support this belief, or the difference in nutrition is not big enough to matter,” Lusk said.
Additional key results include:
Religious consumers, namely Protestants, Catholics and Jews, tend to be happier with both their diets and their lives.
Religious affiliation correlates with some food behaviors like vegetarianism, but few generalizable trends emerge.
Consumers largely think fresh food is better than frozen food, although frozen foods compete better on price.
The average length of time that households are staying on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has continued to increase over 13 months.
Reported food spending remains flat on a monthly basis, even though consumers feel that food inflation is easing.
The survey found no change in the food insecurity rate, a sign that most people are managing under current conditions, said Sam Polzin, a food and agriculture survey scientist for the center and co-author of the report.
Polzin noted, however, that the portion of Americans who are food insecure and who rely on SNAP benefits has now seen their increased SNAP benefits end along with the public health response to COVID-19.
This month’s closer look at religious demographics revealed few clear patterns except that Protestant, Catholic and Jewish people report experiencing higher rates of diet satisfaction and life happiness compared to other groups.
“Other research similarly shows that religious people are happier than those who are unaffiliated with a religious tradition, so these results are relatively unsurprising,” Polzin noted. “However, the fact that people who we have grouped under other faiths are not doing as well is notable.
“I might guess that more people who are inactive members of a religious group or who broadly identify as spiritual selected the ‘other’ option, which might relate to their happiness.”
Polzin further observed that religion was an inexact social indicator when it comes to food-related behaviors, beliefs and trust.
“Our takeaway from many of these sections should be that religious affiliation does not provide a very coherent lens for understanding most food behaviors,” Polzin said. “We would have more success identifying the influence of religion in the context of other socioeconomic and demographic variables.”
Lusk further discusses the report in his blog.

In addition to the Consumer Food Insights Report, the center offers a portfolio of online dashboards.","[{'summary_text': 'religious consumers, namely Protestants, Catholics and Jews, tend to be happier with both their diets and their lives . religious affiliation correlates with some food behaviors like vegetarianism, but few generalizable trends emerge .'}]"

"Purdue engineer, IU cardiologist collaborate to offer innovative tool and fresh hope for babies with heart defects","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
When he was a medical student, none of Mark Payne’s textbooks told him that a cardiologist should consult an engineer before deciding on a patient’s treatment.
But today, as a pediatric cardiologist with Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health and professor at IU’s School of Medicine, Payne wouldn’t consider investigating how to make the best use of an echocardiogram to evaluate congenital heart defects without involving engineers from Purdue University.
Pavlos Vlachos, the St. Vincent Health Professor of Healthcare Engineering and director of the Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering, leads a Purdue team whose recent innovations are on track to be a game-changer for cardiac surgeons and to rewrite cardiology textbooks. Working with Payne, who contributes clinical and medical expertise, the two researchers are confident that they can help save babies’ lives by making echocardiograms — ultrasound image recordings of the heart — much more useful and surgery decisions far better informed.

Gardeners asked to be vigilant this spring for invasive jumping worms,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
While earthworms in the spring are a happy sight for gardeners, an invasive worm species is wreaking havoc for landowners and gardeners in southern Indiana.
Robert Bruner, Purdue Extension’s exotic forest pest specialist, describes jumping worms, an invasive species to North America in the genus Amynthas: “Traditionally, when we see earthworms, they are deep in the ground and a little slimy. The jumping worms are a little bit bigger, kind of dry and scaly, and tend to thrash around much like a snake does.”
While worms have a reputation as a helpful species found in the soil ecosystem, invasive jumping worms do not live up to that standard, Bruner explained. Jumping worms will consume all organic material from the top layer of soil, leaving behind a coffee ground-like waste with no nutrients for plants or seeds.
Since jumping worms stay within the first few inches of topsoil, they are not creating channels for water and air the way earthworms do, disrupting water flow to plant roots.
“So basically, they’re just very nasty pests that ruin the quality of our soil, and the only thing that can really grow in soil like that are essentially invasive plants, or species that are meant to survive really harsh conditions,” Bruner said.
Currently, the worms are being found in cities around southern Indiana, he said, particularly in Terre Haute. There is still much to learn about jumping worms, making eradication efforts difficult. One thing that is known, Bruner said, is they aren’t a migrating species.
“This is the kind of invasive pest that is moved almost entirely through human activity. They don’t crawl superfast,” he explained. “So, when they move, that means they’re moving because we’re transferring soil, say, from someone’s plants or someone’s compost and we’re bringing them to a new area.”
Bruner is working with fellow Purdue Extension educators to spread the message that gardeners should not share ground soil or compost and avoid potted plants from unknown sources. If you suspect jumping worms are present in your own soil, Bruner suggests a process called solarizing to eliminate unwanted pests. Gardeners should lay down a black or dark-toned tarp on a sunny day and sprinkle a thin layer of soil on top, allowing it to reach a temperature over 105 degrees Fahrenheit.
Bruner cautions that jumping worms can escape during the solarizing process, “so you need to completely wrap the soil up in the tarp, essentially making the world’s worst sandwich, and allow it to heat up and kill whatever is in there.”
Bruner said whether the worms will create a major issue for gardeners this season remains to be seen, but he isn’t as concerned for farmers.
“It’s a bit of a nightmare pest if you do gardening, but we don’t have evidence yet that it will spread into agricultural fields,” he said. “We don’t think it’s going to kill any kind of industry. We’re asking people to be on the lookout and use your best judgment when you’re getting your soil.”
Any invasive species sightings should be reported to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources at depp@dnr.in.gov or by calling 1-866-663-9684.

Wheelchair prototype safely navigates passengers through airports to aircraft seats,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Teams of recent Purdue University graduates have honed a patent-pending, dynamically adjustable wheelchair prototype designed to help users more efficiently and safely navigate airports, board aircraft and move through narrow aisleways to their seats.
A nine-minute video about the work is online.
Peter Ponticello, a recent alumnus of Purdue University’s Polytechnic Institute and a team member who worked to fine-tune the design, said navigating an airport requires addressing various floor surfaces and narrow aircraft aisles.
“It is extremely difficult for a passenger to board an airplane without requiring constant assistance from a dedicated usher throughout the process,” Ponticello said.
The current standard for wheelchair users is to transfer between multiple devices: wheelchairs, airport buggies and aisle chairs when boarding and deplaning a commercial aircraft. This requires airport personnel to lift and move passengers from one device to another, which could lead to physical harm.
Brad Duerstock is a power wheelchair user and professor of practice in the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering and School of Industrial Engineering; he is unrelated to the wheelchair prototype design project.
“The requirement to transfer to a normal airline seat is fraught with many hazards that have led to personal injury to the wheelchair user and/or the airline attendant,” Duerstock said.
Typical transfers of wheelchair users between their wheelchair and an aisle chair occurs in the jetway.
“It always delays the boarding of passengers who must wait for the wheelchair user to be physically transferred into the aisle chair and then enter into the airplane and then transfer again into airplane seat,” Duerstock said. “This is not only dangerous but very inefficient.”
Ponticello, Connor Edwards, Logan Gardocki and Cole Mulzer are recent Purdue graduates, and Jack Moran is scheduled to graduate this year. They worked on a remote-operated and battery-powered base for the wheelchair that functions as all three traditionally employed devices.
“It travels omnidirectionally and features an improved turn radius compared to currently available wheelchairs,” Ponticello said.
The base also dynamically contracts from 18-by-18-by-22-inch to 18-by-10-by-22 to pass through narrow aisles.
The original design won the 2020 FAA Challenge: Smart Connected Aviation Student Competition. Team members were Austin Barrow, Eric Eagon, Quinn Joyce, Dylan Kerr, James Pannullo and Xingmei Zhu from the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Brendan Kerr from the Department of Computer Science. Eagon and Joyce were co-leaders; Dengfeng Sun, a professor in the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, served as the team’s academic mentor. Another Polytechnic team of Tyler Affolder, Allana Brown, Brandon Mair, Caleb Phillips, Wade Ridge and Joseph Warren also worked on design. James Condron, assistant professor of practice, advised both Purdue Polytechnic Institute teams.
“After we studied previous versions of the design, we updated the software, redid the electrical setup and redesigned the mechanical features,” Ponticello said.
Along with being safer than traditional methods to transport passengers to planes, Ponticello said the device is cost-efficient for airports.
“This wheelchair allows for those who need to utilize a wheelchair in an airport to do so without the constant assistance of an usher,” Ponticello said. “This greatly reduces the amount that airports spend on ushers who assist those with limited mobility.”
The first team that worked on the design disclosed it to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent on the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in further developing the design should contact Matt Halladay, mrhalladay@prf.org, about track code 2020-JOYC-68976.
The Purdue teams have validated the concept of the design by testing it on a variety of flooring surfaces and through spaces that replicate the dimensions of aircraft aisleways. Commercial partners are being sought to advance the design further, including enabling it to transport a passenger from an airport entrance and then take them to a designated gate and exact aisle seat on an aircraft.

"Biologists, chemical engineers collaborate to reveal complex cellular process inside petunias","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Once upon a time, prevailing scientific opinion might have pronounced recently published research in Nature Communications by a team of Purdue University scientists as unneeded. Now, climate change implications have heightened the need for this line of research.
Flowers emit scent chemicals called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Earlier this year, the Purdue team published the paper identifying for the first time a protein that plays a key role in helping petunias emit volatiles. The article was selected for the “plants and agriculture” section of the journal’s editors’ highlights webpage.
Natalia Dudareva, who led the study, and her longtime collaborator John Morgan had suggested years ago in grant proposals that molecular processes could be involved in VOC emission. Both times the grant reviewers said there was nothing to look for because simple diffusion was the answer.
“We failed twice because people did not believe us,” said Dudareva, director of the Center for Plant Biology and Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry. “We decided we have to have proof that it’s not simple diffusion, that molecular mechanisms are involved.”
The new work builds on findings that the Dudareva-Morgan collaboration announced in 2015 and 2017 showing how biology helps control the release of scent compounds from plants. The latest paper, chiefly funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, focuses on how volatiles cross the cell wall, the barrier that separates the cellular interior from a plant’s outermost protective layer, the cuticle.
“We were looking at whether or not there are proteins that facilitate the transport of these small organic molecules across the cell wall layer,” said Morgan, a professor of chemical engineering.
“The best analogy is to the transport of oxygen in muscle tissue by a protein called myoglobin.”
Volatile organic chemicals are small molecules that have low water solubility. The cell wall, however, is a water-filled environment. This slows the diffusion rate of VOCs because their concentrations cannot build up very high.
“What happens is a protein can bind a lot of these molecules inside a non-waterlike cavity, and it improves or increases the net transport rate,” Morgan explained.
The work has significant practical implications, ranging from the health of the planet to industrial operations. Plants now emit 10 billion metric tons of carbon annually, a quantity that will increase with continued global warming. Floral volatiles also help to protect plants against environmental stresses and are heavily used in the cosmetics industry and in aromatherapy.
“And our diet depends on insect-pollinated plants,” Dudareva said. With global warming, flowers may start blooming earlier, before insects are ready to begin pollination.
The team’s 2015 paper published in the journal Trends in Plant Science reported calculations that had determined the concentration of volatiles needed to sustain the experimentally measured floral emission rate. The concentration reached the millimolar range, a scale that chemists use to quantify substances containing huge numbers of molecules or atoms.
“These compounds will accumulate inside membranes and such high concentration will destroy membranes and destroy the cell,” Dudareva said. This left a clear-cut conclusion: simple diffusion would be impossible.
The initial work had been calculated for snapdragons. But the Purdue researchers focused on petunias for their latest study because, unlike snapdragons, they can be genetically modified to study how particular genes affect the emission process.
“It’s much easier to work with petunias because emission is high, especially during the night,” said Pan Liao, a lead co-author and former Purdue postdoctoral scientist, now an assistant professor of biology at Hong Kong Baptist University. “The emission is strongly regulated in a diurnal pattern.”
Additional co-authors were Itay Maoz, a former Purdue postdoctoral scientist now of Israel’s Agricultural Research Organization; Meng-Ling Shih, PhD 2022, chemical engineering; Xing-Qi Huang, a postdoctoral scientist working in Dudareva’s lab; and Ji Hee Lee, a graduate student in biochemistry. The co-authors contributed a complementary blend of skills and expertise to the work that has become a hallmark of the longstanding collaboration between the Dudareva and Morgan research groups.
Dudareva’s group generated the transgenic plants and handled the cellular biology needed to determine whether a given protein contributes to the volatile emissions. There is no way, however, to detect the level of proteins in a cell or how their concentration changes across a cell wall.
It then fell to Morgan’s group to perform the calculations that quantified the protein contributions and conduct computer simulations to verify the experimental data.
“It’s important to have feedback between the modeling predictions and the actual data,” Morgan said. “Sometimes it starts with the data, then we go do math, and then we go back and compare to the data.”","[{'summary_text': 'a purdue team identified for the first time a protein that plays a key role in helping petunias emit volatiles . with global warming, flowers may start blooming earlier, before insects are ready to begin pollination .'}]"
Snyder Lecture speaker to focus on land-grant universities’ role in shaping the future of higher education,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Jay T. Akridge, Trustee Chair in Teaching and Learning Excellence, professor of agricultural economics, and former Purdue University provost, will be the guest speaker at 48th annual James C. Snyder Memorial Lecture.
The lecture, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. April 21 in the David C. Pfendler Hall of Agriculture’s Deans Auditorium (Room 241), located at 715 Mitch Daniels Blvd. (West State Street).
“Calls for change are nothing new to higher education,” Akridge said. “However, from the coming decline in the number of traditional college-age students and other demographic shifts, to rapid developments in learning technologies and new providers, to public uncertainty about value and commensurate funding challenges, colleges and universities currently face a set of existential questions about their future.”
Akridge’s lecture, “Shaping the Future of Higher Education? Becoming a Land-grant University for Our Times,” will outline some of the most important factors facing higher education and focus on how a land-grant university can position itself for relevance and societal impact.
Akridge most recently served as Purdue’s provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity from 2017-22, the Glenn W. Sample Dean of Agriculture from 2009-17, and director of the Purdue Center for Food and Agricultural Business from 2000-07.
He is the recipient of numerous honors, including the Charles Murphy Award for Distinguished Undergraduate Teaching, Purdue’s Book of Great Teachers (2003), and being named a University Faculty Scholar (2000). Before moving into administration, Akridge was the James and Lois Ackerman Professor of Agricultural Economics. His research focuses on strategic management of food and agribusiness firms and adoption of new technology by agribusiness. He has worked with agribusiness managers in the areas of strategy and marketing in more than 20 countries.
Akridge joins a list of respected leaders in agricultural business and economics who have served as guest speakers for the James C. Snyder Memorial Lecture. The lecture series is the Department of Agricultural Economics’ signature annual event and was established in 1975 in honor of James C. Snyder, who served at Purdue as a professor and researcher in agricultural economics.

"Purdue University named No. 16 among World’s Most Innovative Companies, No. 1 in education","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University, for the first time, has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies – coming in at No. 16 overall and No. 1 in education – for its advances in the vital field of semiconductors and microelectronics.
The only university among Fast Company magazine’s prestigious Top 50 Most Innovative Companies, No. 16 Purdue follows OpenAI (at No. 1, developer of ChatGPT and Dall-E) and leads NASA (No. 17) and The Walt Disney Company (No. 25) as organizations “paving the way for the innovations of tomorrow” and “setting the standard with some of the greatest accomplishments of the modern world.” Overall, the list acknowledges 540 organizations across 54 categories and regions around the world.
Fast Company cited Purdue as a renowned and globally recognized leader in developing a robust and comprehensive program addressing semiconductors through their life cycle from research to training to fabrication to the workforce. The tiny electronics that power almost everything with an “on” switch – and the workforce that keeps them functioning – are vital to almost every industry and product on Fast Company’s list, from NASA’s telescopes to Disney’s animatronic princesses.
“Without chips today, it would be like living in the 1940s,” said Mark Lundstrom, senior advisor to the Purdue president and the university’s chief semiconductor officer. “Chips are the most sophisticated technology that human beings produce, and it takes a highly educated workforce to manufacture them. Purdue is responding with innovation and initiative to prepare the industry’s next generation.”
By 2027 the nation will need a minimum of 50,000 trained semiconductor engineers to meet an accelerating demand for the tiny electronic devices that put the “smart” into our smartphones, cars and medical devices – not to mention our nation’s military and defense technologies.
Purdue answered the call by launching the Semiconductor Degrees Program, a suite of degrees and credentials to enable a quick ramp-up of in-demand skilled talent and create the next generation of semiconductor experts and personnel to reassert American preeminence in this critical industry.
“The graduates from these programs – from PhDs to associate degree-holders – will be at the forefront of innovation as we revitalize American manufacturing,” said Gina M. Raimondo, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, during a 2022 tour of campus research facilities.
Purdue innovation is helping lead the way in addressing this world issue. Not only is Purdue’s Semiconductor Degrees Program the only large-scale, interdisciplinary semiconductor degree program available in the United States, but it also touts a number of features not found in any other educational program. This includes a host of collaborative opportunities, such as the Department of Defense’s microelectronics workforce development initiative, SCALE (Scalable Asymmetric Lifecycle Engagement).
SCALE, headed by Purdue’s College of Engineering, brings together faculty from 16 other universities and experts from 34 additional industry partners – including the Department of Defense, NASA and the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration – to give students access to internships, careers and cutting-edge research opportunities in semiconductors.
The federally funded $30 million SCALE program will increase potential enrollment from 200 to 1,000 students, increasing access and allowing development of a K-12 learning model.
Purdue has also partnered with Ivy Tech Community College, the nation’s largest singly accredited statewide community college system, to develop industry-driven credentials and experience programs. The collaboration brings Purdue’s resources to populations that may not have had access to this type of program while upskilling a motivated workforce.
Investments in the future of the workforce have also drawn innovative neighbors to Purdue. U.S.-owned semiconductor manufacturer SkyWater Technology and Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc., the world’s fourth-largest chip designer by revenue, have each announced partnerships with Purdue in the last year.
SkyWater plans to open a $1.8 billion state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facility in Discovery Park District at Purdue, a 400-acre, mixed-use development adjacent to campus. This will provide investing companies access to both Purdue University faculty experts and highly sought-after graduates prepared to work in the industry.
Building the company’s first semiconductor chip design center in the Midwest, and the first to be housed directly on a university campus, MediaTek Inc. will provide an opportunity for students to complete their engineering education and contribute directly to product design and solutions for a global team.
Purdue has been named a Fast Company Brand That Matters for two years in a row – the only university on the list both years. The annual designation honors organizations for communicating their brand’s mission and ideals with intention and authenticity. Purdue also has enjoyed five consecutive years as a top 10 Most Innovative university as designated by U.S. News & World Report.
In addition to the now-iconic tuition freeze, which is entering its 12th consecutive year, Purdue was named the country’s No. 4 most trusted public university by Morning Consult and is recognized as a top 10 public university by The Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education. It boasts 34 academic programs ranked in the top 10 by U.S. News & World Report, including No. 1 graduate programs in agricultural and biological engineering, and analytical chemistry, and No. 1 online master’s programs in electrical engineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering and engineering management.
“It is exciting for Purdue to be recognized in such a public channel for excellence at scale: generating talent, jobs and knowledge together, and for the benefit of Indiana and America,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “We strive to be the most consequential public university in creating, disseminating and deploying knowledge in areas making the most significant difference in society. In particular, we will keep pushing the frontiers of semiconductors learning, research and industry partnership.”
The March/April issue of Fast Company magazine, including the complete list of the World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies, is available online now and will be on newsstands beginning March 14. Additional coverage of Purdue, including an interview with President Chiang, will appear in the May/June Fast Company print issue, which will be on newsstands beginning May 9.

"Helping construction material manufacturers reduce the energy consumption, carbon footprint of heating and cooling homes","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Heating and cooling homes carries a hefty economic and environmental price tag. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported more than half of all home energy in the United States is used for heating and cooling, and it also represents more than 14% of the nation’s overall energy use. According to the World Green Building Council, the buildings and construction sector is responsible for 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions.
Mirian Velay-Lizancos, a Purdue University assistant professor of civil engineering from the Lyles School of Civil Engineering in the College of Engineering, is addressing these issues. She and researchers in her laboratory have developed a patent-pending, scalable, automatable process that improves upon the traditional method to incorporate phase change materials, or PCMs, into construction materials.
The incorporation of PCMs like paraffin, esters and salt hydrates into building envelope elements moderates the effect of outside temperature changes on the indoor environment. They convert changes in thermal energy into phase changes by transitioning from a solid into a liquid, or the opposite. They provide useful cooling or heat by absorbing or releasing energy during those transitions.
“Incorporating PCMs reduces energy consumption in buildings, which reduces carbon dioxide emissions and operational costs,” Velay-Lizancos said. “It also decreases water permeability of construction materials.”
PCMs are used in a building’s envelope, or the doors, exterior walls, foundations, roofs, windows and other components that create a barrier between the indoors and the outdoors. The thermal properties of building envelopes play a key role in a building’s energy consumption.
“Increasing the heat storage capabilities of building envelopes would reduce the effect of temperature fluctuations in a building,” Velay-Lizancos said. “This would increase the thermal comfort of the building and decrease energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and related economic costs of heating and cooling. It also would make buildings more resilient and energy independent and less susceptible to power outages and other energy supply issues.”
Velay-Lizancos said traditional methods to add PCMs in construction materials have drawbacks.
“Currently, PCMs are incorporated into other materials via microencapsulation or macroencapsulation,” Velay-Lizancos said. “However, these methods limit the use of PCMs. Microencapsulation has a negative effect on the strength and durability of construction materials. Macroencapsulation limits the shape and production method of construction materials.”
Velay-Lizancos’ method uses liquid immersion and a vacuum to incorporate PCMs after construction materials like bricks, drywall and concrete have already been formed. A two-minute video of the method is online.
“This increases the strength, enhances the durability and increases the thermal inertia of the construction materials,” Velay-Lizancos said. “This new method also distributes PCMs so they are concentrated in the surface layer of the construction materials. More of the PCMs are in contact with external surfaces of the building envelope, which makes the PCMs more effective.”
Velay-Lizancos’ method requires only a vacuum system, which she said is very accessible and easy for manufacturers to work with.
“Users will need to be familiarized with the process, but they will not need special training,” Velay-Lizancos said. “The process could be easily automatized and incorporated into the production chain of precast elements like bricks, concrete panels, drywall and pavers, among others.”
Velay-Lizancos and her research group tested the innovation at the Pankow Laboratory in the Lyles School of Civil Engineering. The initial tests were conducted with commercial bricks and 15 minutes of vacuum time.
A large experimental campaign was conducted on cement mortars with three water-to-cement ratios and, therefore, different initial porosity levels. PCMs were incorporated into the mortars for three different vacuum periods: 15 minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours. Velay-Lizancos and her team observed an increase on the thermal inertia of 24% and over a 22% of increase in the compressive strength, with just 7% of the volume of the element filled with PCM.
Velay-Lizancos said the uneven distribution of the PCM concentrated in the surface layer makes the PCM more effective in enhancing thermal properties.
“The method used in this study introduces the PCM into the layer of the material that is closer to the material’s surface, meaning that more will be in contact with the external surfaces of the building envelope, resulting in more effective usage of the PCM,” Velay-Lizancos said. “Furthermore, this method pushes the PCM material into the capillary pores through the vacuum. Due to the capillary forces, leakage of PCM was not observed, even when the final composite was exposed to high temperatures well above the melting point of the PCM used.”
A paper about Velay-Lizancos’ research methods and results has been published in the March 2023 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Construction and Building Materials (Elsevier).
The next milestone to develop the PCM incorporation method is to build a full-scale prototype.
“This will allow us to visualize with cameras and sensors the thermal performance of the building envelope,” Velay-Lizancos said. “Clients will have the hard data and also be able to visualize the advantages of this technology.”
Velay-Lizancos disclosed the innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for a patent on the intellectual property. Industry partners seeking to further develop this innovation should contact Parag Vasekar, psvasekar@pf.org, about reference number 2022-VELA-69766, “Novel Building Envelope Materials with Enhanced Durability That Reduce Energy Consumption.”

Discovery of the ‘bubble phase of composite fermions’ confirms existence of a new family of quantum matter,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Like finding a hidden world, physicists dialing up the magnetic field on a semiconducting material have discovered the first in a new family of matter that flowers from the bizarre realm of the quantum scale.
In what researchers dubbed the bubble phase of composite fermions, pairs of quasiparticles align in a crystalline pattern, allowing electricity to flow along the edge of the material. The discovery represents a previously unobserved arrangement of composite fermions, which are entities that behave like particles and are formed from the interaction between electrons and magnetism.
“As the first member of a new family of highly correlated topological phases, this new phase expands our understanding and offers a glimpse of the role of electronic interactions in generating higher order correlations in electronic systems,” said Gábor Csáthy, a Purdue University professor and head of the Department of Physics and Astronomy.

Concord Law School celebrates 25 years since becoming the nation’s first of its kind,"summarize:ANAHEIM, Calif. —
From dial-up to broadband to exploring how to use cutting-edge virtual reality and artificial intelligence in its curriculum, a lot has changed since the first cohort of Concord Law School students logged into their classes in 1998.
Reflections, mixed with a preview of the future, were provided on Saturday (Feb. 25) by Concord Law School Dean Martin Pritikin during the school’s 25th anniversary gala and awards dinner.
“Concord was an audacious concept when it was founded in 1998,” Pritikin said. “But 25 years later, we’re not just surviving, we’re thriving.”
Pritikin said Concord thrives because it is continually combining best practices in legal education with research in adult and distance learning, opening the doors for many students who want to study law but can’t do so at a traditional brick-and-mortar school due to family responsibilities, jobs, geography or other circumstances. Another key factor in the school’s success: It costs about one-third less than a traditional law school.
Jack Goetz, the founding dean of Concord Law School, was honored during the gala with the Founder’s Award for his work in conceiving the nation’s first online law school. Goetz worked with a tech company to custom-tailor a learning management system for Concord. He recruited professors to build the curriculum and teach, helping move the school from a concept to a functioning educational institution. And he served as dean for its first seven years. He is a recognized leader in the field of online learning, with contributions to the legal profession and education throughout his career.
Other awards to alumni and supporters included:
Lifetime Service Award: Dolan Williams of San Diego and a 2015 Concord Law School graduate, who served as commencement speaker this year and two previous times. He has served on the Concord Dean’s Advisory Council for six years and on the Purdue Alumni Association Board of Directors. Williams has also mentored numerous students about law school, legal careers and more, all while maintaining his legal practice in San Diego and spending time with his wife and four children.
Lifetime Service Award: Somita Basu of Santa Clarita, California, and a 2011 Concord Law School graduate, who has represented Concord with distinction in her service to the California legal profession and broader community. In addition to being a co-founder and partner of Norton Basu LLP, she has served as chair of the California Lawyers Association’s Solo and Small Firm Section and co-chair of its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Outreach Committee. Basu has served as an externship supervisor for multiple Concord students, volunteered with Bay Area Legal Aid and served on numerous philanthropic boards. She was recipient of the California Lawyer Association’s Excellence in Leadership Award, which is presented to a volunteer who demonstrates a commitment to the CLA’s mission to promote excellence, diversity and inclusion in the legal profession and represents outstanding leadership in the practice of law.
Lifetime Achievement in Bar Exam Support Award: Steve Bracci of Monrovia, California, who is an associate dean and professor at Concord Law School. Bracci is one of Concord’s original employees. He is known for providing expert instruction and guidance to law students who have sat for the California bar exam, breaking down complicated concepts and presenting them in a way students can absorb, retain and apply.
Several students or recent graduates were recognized for their outstanding personal achievement:
Matt Conaway of Indianola, Iowa, (August ’22) and Condreda Pressley of Longs, South Carolina, (December ’22), both received the Legal Service Award, which honors students who put forth significant effort in helping people in need receive legal assistance.
The Sue Lane Award, honoring students from the graduating class who embody a strong work ethic, a compassionate nature and service to the community, was presented to Sojourner Moody of Oxford, Georgia, (April ’22); Sarah Powers of Irving, Texas, (December ’22); Julio Gagnon of Fairfax, Virginia, (December ’22); and Scott Bowen of Charlotte, North Carolina, (August ’22).
The EJD Award, given to the student with the highest GPA in the Executive Juris Doctorate graduating cohort, was awarded to Brennan Quintus of Bismarck, North Dakota, (August ’22) and Elizabeth Duncan of Eugene, Oregon, (December ’22).
Beth Evans of Redondo Beach, California, (August ’22) and David Douglas of Windsor, California, (December ’22), were recipients of the Jack Goetz Award, which is awarded to the student with the highest GPA in the JD graduating cohort.",[{'summary_text': 'a lot has changed since the first cohort of Concord law school students logged into their classes in 1998 . the school is continually combining best practices in legal education with research in adult and distance learning . it costs about one-third less than a traditional law school .'}]
Novilytic preps for expansion with launch of new Proteometer-L,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Novilytic LLC, a molecular-recognition company that uses nanotechnology to monitor the quality of lifesaving medicines, has released its first product, the Proteometer-L. The company’s goal is that sales from the product will enable rapid hiring for its commercialization and science teams and expansion into a second location in Indianapolis.
Short for “proteoform meter,” the Proteometer-L is sold in a kit as the world’s first technology for at-line molecular structure analysis and quantification. It is compatible with bioreactors and performs analyses of medicinal batches roughly every 10 minutes. The new tech enables process R&D scientists and drug manufacturers to recognize when a product run is going awry in near real time.
“This quick analysis saves up to six-plus hours a day and over $1 million per batch, increasing both profits and FDA compliance,” said Fred Regnier, PhD, Novilytic CTO and emeritus professor of chemistry at Purdue University. “The Proteometer kit is designed as a ‘plug and play’ consumable, ensuring easy adoption in almost all of the more than 250,000 instruments currently used in the pharmaceutical industry.”
Novilytic’s first product launch comes on the heels of successful pilot programs with large instrument manufacturers and contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs. These successful pilots have led to discussions for sales contracts that the company hopes to announce soon.
“With this as our official foray into commercialization, we are being incredibly diligent to cross our t’s and dot our i’s. The goal of our numerous pilot programs was to demonstrate that our solution works in potential customers’ laboratories, not just ours,” said Paul Dreier, Novilytic CEO. “We are thrilled to share that our customer training was less than one hour, and the pilot data looks as good and even better than ours in many cases.”
The development of the Proteometer-L was made possible due to a $1.6 million funding round with multiple investors, including the Purdue Research Foundation. These funds provided the basis for Novilytic to test multiple drugs currently on the market, proving that the patented Luminon® and MASC® technology in fact works in a real-world setting.
“Novilytic’s technology represents a major disrupter in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. It could lead to enhanced FDA compliance in a day and age where transparency and accuracy are paramount,” said Riley Gibb, associate director of Purdue Ventures. “We’re extremely proud to have them in our portfolio of early-stage startups and are looking forward to both the industry reaction to this product as well as Novilytic’s future offerings.”
In addition to the investment, Purdue Research Foundation worked with Novilytic to create a technology licensing and servicing agreement and provided several industry connections that have resulted in strategic partnerships for the company.
Novilytic is already planning a large-scale expansion to meet anticipated demand. This includes key hires for product management, operations and the laboratory team. The company is also looking to expand its West Lafayette laboratory and open an Indianapolis-area satellite office. Current job openings include director of analytics, manufacturing engineer and staff analytical scientist.
The L in the Proteometer-L name stands for Luminon, which is a type of molecular-recognition agent that the company has trademarked. Novilytic plans to release additional Proteometer kits that are assay- and vertical-specific later in 2023. Secondary markets may include, but are not limited to, veterinary health, other antibodies, proteins and the ELISA market.
Novilytic – The Canary in the FermentorTM – is a molecular-recognition company that utilizes nanotechnology to monitor the quality of lifesaving drugs. The company is backed by strong partnerships with large analytical companies, AI leaders and pharmaceutical consortiums. Our potency is extended by the Novilytic team, which includes multiple PhD chemists and engineers who have helped us secure significant patents and other IP. Our business plan will increase those forces to ensure we meet customer, market and regulatory demands. Learn more at Novilytic.com.

"Purdue Global celebrates nearly 1,000 graduates in Anaheim commencement ceremonies","summarize:Info for journalists
ANAHEIM, Calif. —
Dolan Williams found himself listening to the “Hamilton” soundtrack while working at a law firm — especially the song “Hurricane.”
Williams likened the lyrics of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical about Alexander Hamilton to the life of the graduates he was speaking to: people who overcame personal challenges by deciding — in this case — to pursue higher education through Purdue Global to improve their lives, families and communities.
Williams, a graduate of Concord Law School, provided the keynote address to 990 Purdue Global graduates taking part in person and virtually in commencement ceremonies on Saturday (Feb. 25) at the City National Grove of Anaheim.
“My hurricane was a combination of struggles I had growing up and believing that I could make something of myself,” Williams said. “How this affected me growing up was that I learned failure wasn’t an option because there was no backup plan. As I got older, got married and had children, I knew if I let the hurricane of my youth consume me, my family would suffer, too. The life raft for me, like many of you, was an education and a commitment to my growing family.”
Williams was working as an online college advisor in 2010 when he decided to make a career change and pursue law school. As the sole provider for his family of six, a traditional path was not feasible, so he chose Concord. Since 2017 he has operated the Law Office of Dolan M. Williams, located in San Diego. Williams, who also spoke at the February 2020 commencement in Los Angeles and the December 2020 virtual ceremony, supports Purdue Global by volunteering his time to assist with prospective student webinars and serving on the Concord Law School Advisory Council.
“My experiences of staying up late at night wondering whether I could afford to feed my family shaped me for the better. It taught me what I was made of and gave me the confidence that if I could live through that, I could live through anything,” Williams said. “Just one degree later, I see the fruits of the labor I put in years ago, and I promise you will, too.”
Degrees were awarded from the schools of Business and Information Technology, Education, General Education, Health Sciences, Nursing, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Concord Law School. There were 478 bachelor’s degrees, 304 master’s degrees, 115 associate degrees, 73 certificates and 20 doctoral degrees (two Doctor of Nursing Practice, nine Juris Doctor and nine Executive Juris Doctor).
The graduates reside in 46 states — including 176 California residents and 56 from Indiana — as well as Bermuda, Canada, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saipan, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Some 178 graduates are affiliated with the military. Seven systemwide Purdue University employees are among those earning a Purdue Global degree or certificate via the Purdue Global education benefit.
Chancellor Frank Dooley addressed the graduates — 483 who registered to attend in person and 507 virtually — their families and friends.
Dooley noted that over 9,300 Purdue Global students are affiliated with the military, including nearly 5,000 active duty, National Guard and reserve members serving worldwide; over 1,400 military families; and over 2,900 veterans. Almost half of Purdue Global students are the first in their family to attend college, while more than half care for a child or other dependent.
Dooley talked about the changes in technology, society and higher education, including the advancement of artificial intelligence across industries.
“Artificial intelligence has helped to increase efficiencies and further personalize learning,” Dooley said. “The future is here. I know some of you will work with these technologies. Others may go on to advance them.”
Eileen Cabale from Las Vegas, who received a Master of Science degree in instructional design and technology, performed the national anthem during the first ceremony. Melissa Johnson from Morgan Hill, Calif., who received a medical assistant certificate, performed the national anthem during the second ceremony.
Purdue University President Mung Chiang congratulated the graduates via a video message.
The Feb. 25 ceremonies marked Purdue Global’s 16th commencement since its formation in 2018 and the second in Southern California. In California Purdue Global boasts 2,347 active students and 3,078 alumni.
In the days leading up to commencement, Purdue Global hosted various virtual celebratory events, including a toast, graduation “shout out” board and social media activities. Also in Anaheim was an in-person Black and Gold Celebration and Military Appreciation Dinner, as well as a 25th anniversary celebration for the Concord Law School.
The next Purdue Global commencement is scheduled for May 6 on the Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, Indiana.

Commencement speaker to grads: You can overcome the hurricanes of life,"summarize:Dolan Williams, an alum of the Concord Law School at Purdue Global, made these remarks during the Purdue Global commencement on Saturday (Feb. 25) in Anaheim, California.
Graduates, family, friends and the entire Purdue community, welcome! My name is Dolan Williams, and I am a graduate of Concord Law School at Purdue Global, Class of 2015. It is an honor and a pleasure to be here. If this is your first time visiting Southern California, the answer is yes, the traffic is always this bad, and no, nobody in California knows how to drive.
Here’s how it started:
When I first decided to further my education back in 2005, the company I was working for was having massive layoffs that lasted years, but my wife was staying at home with our kids, and I was the only earner. At this time, my wife and I had more kids while the company I worked for shrank by 50%. My personal life was moving in a direction different than my employer’s, and I knew a job loss would have been devastating but knew an education was my ticket to security and prosperity.
Originally, I started in a graduate program at Arizona State around the same time my oldest was born. What I came to realize was getting started was the easy part. Every day I could feel the pressure mounting to do my best at work to survive but also make sure I got that assignment in before 11:59 p.m. In fact, the day my oldest was born, I had to hand a project to a classmate to turn in for me so I could run to the hospital. Before my program was over, we had two kids, and this photo accurately summarizes how well I handled work, school and home to cross the finish line. I barely made it.
After graduation, I learned that no matter my education, my family was counting me, but I had little control over things like company downsizing. I had trouble sleeping, and my heart broke every time I saw another colleague pack up their desk. I felt so dependent on the decisions of people whom I never met, and those feelings of helplessness were exhausting. I just knew I was next on the chopping block, and for any of you who experienced layoffs, especially during the pandemic, this is probably all too familiar.
I still needed a change if we were to survive. Like so many of you, we had no plan B. I needed something that would help guard against rocky professional waters but also allow me to keep the commitment to my family. One day, I was driving down the street with my wife, and I turned to her and said, “What if I became a lawyer?” Mind you, I didn’t come from a family of lawyers, and I didn’t even know any lawyers at the time. But it didn’t matter. She was all about it
So I had to start looking for how I was going to keep my job and pursue a new degree. So I started looking the way any of us begins a life-changing, meaningful research project.
I Googled it.
Thankfully, Concord Law School pulled up, and I was on the first step in my journey. I told my wife, and she celebrated the idea.
After graduation, when I worked at a law firm in 2017, I would listen to music while researching. I wasn’t a fan of musical theater, but I tried the “Hamilton” soundtrack on a whim. I instantly fell in love with it, and now I’ve seen it live four times.
To be honest, I haven’t shut up about how much I love it since the first time I saw it onstage.
There is one song that stands out to me called “Hurricane.” For those unfamiliar, Alexander Hamilton lived on St. Croix, and this massive hurricane destroyed the island. Hamilton wrote this amazing poem about the wreckage and how some rich folks helped get him off the island and to America to get an education. In the song, Lin-Manuel Miranda says, “I wrote my way out.” The idea is he used his skills, and a little bit of luck, to get off the island, permanently.
But what this said to me was that before he fought for America’s independence, Hamilton fought for his own freedom. Believe it or not, you all did the same thing in your own way. Your hurricane could have been a bad boss. It could have been a bankruptcy, divorce, or maybe you just wanted to finish what you started. Whatever your reason, you wrote your way out.
My hurricane? My hurricane was a combination of struggles I had growing up and believing that I could make something of myself. Like so many people I grew up with, I had a single mom who had some mental health struggles and a father who suffered from the twin demons of drug and alcohol addiction. Ultimately, neither of my parents could survive their hurricanes and died way too young. How this affected me growing up was that I learned failure wasn’t an option because there was no backup plan. As I got older, got married and had children, I knew if I let the hurricane of my youth consume me, my family would suffer, too. The life raft for me, like many of you, was an education and a commitment to my growing family.
I started my program here about three weeks before my youngest daughter was born. I thought finishing my first program was tough, but now with four kids, I had a small army that needed me at my best. Every day, for years, required a daily routine of study, work, time with family, study, rinse and repeat.
This was all without any guarantee that I would finish, while praying I’d survive another round of layoffs. You all know this pattern and feeling all too well.
For students who follow a traditional path to their education, it is hard to adequately explain what it’s like to see you have so many years left in the program but also be worried about getting the bills paid. It’s hard to explain to someone of having a deadline not only for work but also one for school, and a deadline to help your kids finish their presentation for their own class. Just take a moment to consider how impressive and how unusual your accomplishment is, and take a moment to thank your support system for helping you through. I do every day.
Nevertheless, I understand some of you may be scared despite today’s celebration. There may be a promotion, a new job you had your eye on, the bar exam or your boards. You may just be wondering if the degree was even worth it.
I can relate. As I mentioned before, we had just one income, no hope of job security, and to fight the belief I was doomed to the same fate as my parents. I had this recurring nightmare of losing everything, and it seemed like the hopes I had as a kid for giving my kids a more comfortable upbringing was slipping away. Regardless of your circumstance, the point is that I can relate to the fear and anxiety that may be filling your mind.
What I can tell you is this: My experiences of staying up late at night wondering whether I could afford to feed my family shaped me for the better. It taught me what I was made of and gave me the confidence that if I could live through that, I could live through anything. Just one degree later, I see the fruits of the labor I put in years ago, and I promise you will, too.
In closing, the reason Purdue Global chose me to speak is not that I’m a famous person. I haven’t written any bestsellers, and I don’t have my own television show. Purdue Global asked me to speak to you because I am you.
I know what it’s like trying to do your homework AT work. I’ve felt the guilt that comes with not being able to spend as much time with your family as you want. But despite how it started, it was worth it, and I can tell you how it’s going now.
Now, I can actively support my wife the way she supported me, and strengthen the relationship with my kids. I have the pleasure, and the honor, of running my own law practice and don’t stress about layoffs anymore.
I don’t worry about long commutes because I get to work out of my home and spend more time with my family. For the first time in my life, I don’t feel so dependent. I feel independent. Success isn’t just having a long and impressive list of accomplishments; it is the power to live your life on your terms. With your degree, this is the power that you all have NOW.
I survived these hurricanes, and so did each of you. Just like Alexander Hamilton, you wrote your way out, and now it’s time for the next chapter in your story.
Thank you, and congratulations, graduates!",[{'summary_text': 'dolan Williams is an alum of the Concord Law School at Purdue Global . he made the remarks during the purdue global commencement on thursday .'}]

Purdue’s College of Liberal Arts “Degree in 3” program was created to help undergraduate students majoring in liberal arts save time and money while earning their undergraduate degree.
The program has helped many students earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in three years, saving them an average of $9,000 for in-state students and $19,400 for out-of-state and international students. In addition to providing tuition savings, the program allows students to enter the workforce sooner and amass more job experience. The College of Liberal Arts spearheaded this program in response to the student debt crisis to provide students with more money-saving options.
Now, Purdue’s Brian Lamb School of Communication is building off the time and tuition savings offered by the “Degree in 3” track with a new combined degree program that will allow undergraduate students to earn a Bachelor of Arts in communication and a Master of Science in communication in four to five years of study. Students completing the “Degree in 3” bachelor’s track can earn a bachelor’s and a master’s in four years. Traditional students can finish the combined degree program in five years.
Lamb School students in the combined degree program can take up to 12 credit hours that count toward both their bachelor’s and master’s degree beginning in their junior year. The Master of Science in communication is a fully online program, giving students the opportunity to earn graduate credits while working or studying from anywhere.
According to Jessie Stocker, Brian Lamb School of Communication graduate program administrator, the combined degree program provides value to students who are looking to become more competitive job candidates as well as save time and money toward completing two degrees.
“By earning 12 graduate credits while completing an undergraduate degree, students can condense the master’s in communication program, which typically takes two or three years to complete, into one year,” Stocker said. “This saves students a lot of time, and it saves them money on graduate credits.”
Additionally, up to four graduate classes can be included in a student’s undergraduate tuition, saving them an average of $6,200 for in-state students and $9,800 for all other students.
Taking graduate courses gives undergraduate students exposure to in-demand job skills that can make them more competitive candidates in communication fields. It also puts them in contact with other communications professionals in the online Master of Science in communication program.
“Students in the Master of Science in communication program come from dozens of different industries and bring a lot of experience into the program with them,” Stocker said. “When undergraduate students take these courses, they are entering an expansive professional network and learning from industry experts. This makes them more competitive job candidates overall.”

Ukraine Scholars Initiative expands and receives Heritage Group gift,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A Purdue University program launched in March to provide Ukrainian scholars an opportunity to continue their academic pursuits here during the ongoing Russian invasion of their home country has received a grant from The Heritage Group to extend the initiative into May 2024.
The Indianapolis-based Heritage Group is donating $270,000 to support all nine participants in Purdue’s Ukrainian Scholars Initiative for another academic year. This extends funding through the Spring 2024 semester, officials with Purdue and Heritage Group announced Wednesday (Feb. 22). In addition to renewing the program, Purdue officials plan to expand it for a new class of Ukrainian scholars whose academic endeavors remain stalled by Russia’s invasion.
“When President (Mitch) Daniels launched the Ukrainian Scholars Initiative in March 2022, Purdue continued our distinct tradition of welcoming those scholars and students seeking refuge from tyranny and a home for liberty,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “We hope the Ukrainian scholars in our community can return to safety and freedom in Ukraine one day soon. In the meantime, through Heritage Group’s resounding support and our firm commitment, we will renew and expand this initiative on a campus for the free minds.”
Purdue established the Ukrainian Scholars Initiative in what was among the first and is now the largest and most ambitious university-led program in the country. The goal: to assist these faculty members and scholars whose academic pursuits have been derailed by the conflict, which marks its one-year anniversary on Friday (Feb. 24).
Of more than 100 applications, Purdue was able to accept approximately 20 individuals. Nine scholars eventually enrolled in the program to resume their research and studies, said Mike Brzezinski, Purdue vice president for global partnerships and programs. Since its March 2022 launch, Brzezinski has led Purdue’s Ukrainian Scholars Initiative along with associate provost Peter Hollenbeck; Amanda Thompson, director of International Scholar Services in Purdue’s International Students and Scholars program; and ISS counselors Chad Broeker and Austin Smith.
The first Ukrainian scholar arrived in May and the ninth was on campus by November, all with the expectation they would be here for at least 12 months.
“For 90 years, the Heritage Group has been committed to building a safer, more enriching and sustainable world by harnessing the power of family,” said Sara Morris, director of strategic initiatives for Heritage Group. “When we saw the war and heartbreak in Ukraine and then learned of Purdue’s efforts to support Ukrainian scholars, we knew immediately we wanted to help. We are fortunate to be able to support this initiative to enrich the lives of the individual Ukrainian scholars, their families, all who come into contact with them at Purdue, and our own team members.”
The Heritage Group expressed an interest in the Purdue program during its very early stages last spring and has been engaged ever since, Brzezinski said. Greg Kapp, vice president for development at Purdue for Life, and Diane Klassen, chief development officer of university initiatives for Purdue Research Foundation, were instrumental in collaborating with Brzezinski to secure the donation from The Heritage Group.
“After the arrival of all of our nine scholars, The Heritage Group was eager to learn more about each individual and to know how they could help,” Brzezinski said. “We’re so very pleased and grateful that they are contributing the majority of funding needed to sponsor each scholar for one year. Individuals from Heritage also are eager to meet our Ukrainian faculty and students, a sign that they are truly interested in their well-being.”
Additionally, the various unit hosts of the scholars within Purdue and the Greater Lafayette community have decided to continue their financial and humanitarian support of the program through May 2024, Brzezinski said. Indeed, as the world marks the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the strong Purdue-Greater Lafayette community connection has been essential to the success of the program, Brzezinski said.
William and Liesl Shen, Purdue alumni who own Crestview Apartments in West Lafayette, originally set aside 19 units since the spring to be used by the scholars; six scholars live there now. And over 20 families from Faith Church in Lafayette have given their time and resources to furnish the scholars’ apartments.
Through the Purdue program, the Ukrainian visiting scholars are engaging in their own research or supporting research conducted by Purdue faculty members. Additionally, several are enrolled in doctoral programs and at the dissertation research stage of their degree programs. Their impressive scholarship stretches across a diversity of disciplines — from chemistry, library sciences, psychology, linguistics, communication, sociology and neuroscience to political science, management, history, and earth and planetary sciences.

Purdue police investigating reports of fraud related to purchasing basketball tickets,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue University Police Department is investigating several reports of fraud related to attempted purchases of Purdue men’s basketball tickets.
According to police, the fraudulent tickets are often posted on the mobile group messaging app, GroupMe. The person trying to sell the tickets poses as a student and sends the potential purchaser a picture of an ID card of an actual Purdue student, one who may have already fallen victim to the scam.
Police say these scams have also occurred on Facebook Marketplace. The person trying to sell the tickets texts with the potential purchaser in an attempt to gain their confidence, and then asks for the payment through online transaction platforms, including Venmo and Zelle.
“We understand the demand for basketball tickets is extremely high right now, but we ask that those looking to purchase tickets remain alert and vigilant,” said Purdue police chief Lesley Wiete. “We recommend not purchasing tickets over mobile applications or from people you do not know.”
To report fraud related to basketball tickets, please contact PUPD at 765-494-8221. Police recommend purchasing tickets through StubHub, the official secondary ticketing partner of Purdue Athletics.","[{'summary_text': 'the fraudulent tickets are often posted on the mobile group messaging app, GroupMe . the person trying to sell the tickets poses as a student and sends the potential purchaser a picture of an ID card of an actual Purdue student . police say these scams have also occurred on Facebook Marketplace .'}]"

"Dust explosion incidents increased last year, no fatalities","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The annual summary recording nationwide grain dust bin explosions reported nine incidents in 2022. This compares to seven reported incidents in 2021 and a 10-year average of 7.8 explosions annually.
Kingsly Ambrose, Purdue University professor of agricultural and biological engineering and report author, said that despite the increase in explosions from the previous year and 18 total injuries this year, no fatalities were reported.
The explosions occurred in one ethanol plant, two feed mills, two grain elevators, two rice mills and two grain processing plants. The probable ignition sources were identified in three cases as a fire and one incidence as welding, while five cases were from unknown sources. Fuel sources for all nine explosions were identified as grain dust.
The dust explosions occurred in seven different states, with two each occurring in Arkansas and Louisiana, and one each in New Mexico, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas and Ohio.
“Often, five of the conditions needed for a grain dust explosion to occur are present in most grain feed, milling and processing facilities,” Ambrose said. “These conditions include dust, dispersed dust, confined space and oxygen. The presence of the fifth factor, an ignition source such as overheated bearing or mechanical friction, could lead to an explosion.”
He emphasized the importance of developing and implementing a detailed housekeeping program to mitigate the hazards and utilizing government and industry resources that are publicly available to provide guidance on developing such a program.","[{'summary_text': 'the explosions occurred in one ethanol plant, two feed mills, two grain elevators and two rice mills . no fatalities were reported despite the increase in explosions from previous year .'}]"

"Purdue Ventures invests $250,000 in assistive educational technology company","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue Ventures, which manages three funds to support Purdue University-connected startups, has invested $250,000 in Tactile Engineering Inc., a company that has developed assistive educational technology to enable people affected by blindness and low vision.
Purdue Ventures’ investment is part of a larger $1.5 million funding round for Tactile Engineering that includes investments from Elevate Ventures, Queen City Angels and private individuals.
CEO Dave Schleppenbach said the company’s Cadence tactile tablet allows readers to access up to eight lines of electronic Braille cells.
“Students, professionals and leisure readers can use Cadence to navigate long equations and access technical diagrams,” Schleppenbach said. “Multiple Cadence devices can be linked to form larger readable surfaces.”
Cadence’s refreshable display of electronic cells uses standard Braille size, spacing and height. The modular cells are replaceable, and Tactile Engineering provides web-based support tools to enable remote calibration.
Schleppenbach said Cadence can be used as an e-reader, a graphing calculator and an image viewer.
“It downloads and displays books and documents in a wide range of formats,” Schleppenbach said. “It duplicates the functions of a traditional scientific calculator and allows users to pan, zoom and highlight its tactile output. It also can be used as an image viewer with animated, highlighted and interactive images to demonstrate scientific, geographic and other complex subjects.”
Additional applications are in development, including a web browser, classroom aids, annotation tools, and notetaker and leisure software. Cadence’s built-in Wi-Fi allows users to download and install new apps as they become available.
Schleppenbach said Tactile Engineering strongly supports the national objective to strengthen Braille literacy. He said literacy is critical for gaining employment, especially in high-demand technical and scientific roles.
“According to the National Federation of the Blind, 70% of adults who are blind are unemployed,” Schleppenbach said. “Of those persons with vision impairments who are employed, 90% are Braille-literate.
“Although advances in voice control and speech synthesis might seem to offer a solution to workplace accessibility, such tools cannot provide access to mathematics, technical content or graphics, all of which are vital for equal-opportunity STEM education and employment. The goal of providing this access drives everything we do at Tactile Engineering.”
Schleppenbach said the Purdue Ventures investment and the funding round will allow Tactile Engineering to invest in additional capital equipment, parts and labor to manufacture Cadence in larger quantities. He said the company has other significant ties to Purdue.
“Several of our founders and employees have a Purdue academic background; our original research in the field started while at Purdue,” Schleppenbach said. “The Purdue Manufacturing Extension Partnership has been immensely helpful in providing expertise to develop our robotic assembly plant. Finally, because Cadence has an educational focus, Purdue would be a great avenue for us to develop accessible content and test results with students.”
Riley Gibb, associate director of Purdue Ventures, said Tactile Engineering is a strong addition to the investment portfolio.
“Tactile Engineering has strong connections to Purdue University research, which is a key qualifier for an investment,” Gibb said. “We also appreciate the company is serving an unmet need – strengthening learning in the STEM fields for people who are affected by blindness and low vision – in a unique way with the multiple applications of its Cadence tool.”
Purdue Ventures manages multiple pools of capital in collaboration with the Purdue University entrepreneurial ecosystem and local corporations, enabling Purdue startups to improve the world. It has invested over $12 million since its formation. To support various technologies coming out of the university as well as student or alumni founders, Purdue Ventures manages three funds, each with a different investment focus. Ag-Celerator funds startups looking to commercialize Purdue IP or Purdue “know-how” technologies related to or impacting agriculture. The Foundry Investment Fund supports life science innovation by making up to 30% of institutional capital investments made in Purdue-affiliated startups. The Purdue Startup Fund supports innovation commercialization through early-stage investments.
Tactile Engineering was founded in 2013 with the goal of developing and manufacturing an affordable tactile graphics tablet for use by blind and visually impaired (B/VI) individuals around the world.

Purdue-connected digital health startup wins phase 1 of NIH competition for maternal health,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
HemaChrome, a digital health startup that uses smartphone technology to noninvasively and instantly measure blood hemoglobin levels, has won phase 1 of the National Institutes of Health’s RADx Tech for Maternal Health Challenge.
The technology was developed by Young Kim, HemaChrome’s founder and chief science officer. Kim is a professor and associate head for research at Purdue University’s Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. He also is a Showalter Faculty Scholar and University Faculty Scholar at Purdue. Huiri Kim is HemaChrome’s CEO.
“Blood hemoglobin tests are among the most common laboratory tests because they are an indicator of a variety of diseases and disorders,” Young Kim said. “In fact, they are the most common laboratory tests conducted among obstetric patients. However, more than 2.2 million childbearing women in the U.S. have limited access to such testing.
“Conventional blood hemoglobin tests are usually conducted by invasive and expensive venous blood draws, which require sophisticated equipment, highly trained experts to run the tests and patients who must be present on-site with their health care provider. Our simple app is intended to eliminate these barriers and make these tests accessible to everyone, especially those in health care deserts, by allowing clinicians to conduct point-of-care, home-based and remote diagnostic tests on their patients at a fraction of the cost.”
During phase 1 of the challenge, HemaChrome received a cash prize and was vetted by NIH’s panel of scientific, medical and business experts for technical and commercial viability. Because it won, HemaChrome will have access to NIH’s in-house and in-kind support to speed the development, validation and commercialization of its technology.
HemaChrome meets twice a week with the NIH RADx team of experts as part of the process to proceed to phase 2 of the challenge.
“We are working with the NIH RADx team to identify and mitigate key risk factors for the accelerated development and implementation of our technology,” Young Kim said. “If we progress to the next phase, we will work with them to independently test and verify our technology’s performance and usability.
“Because the process to receive federal funding and support is highly competitive, winning phase 1 of the challenge has strengthened HemaChrome’s resolve to bring our solution to market to benefit those without sufficient health care access who need it most.”
Young Kim’s research about this technology has been published in several publications and peer-reviewed journals, including the November 2022 issue of Blood and the June 2020 issue of Optica. He is preparing additional papers and conducting ongoing clinical studies.
“One of our ongoing clinical studies is historically meaningful,” Kim said. “The institutional review board, or IRB, approval between Purdue University and IU Health Arnett Hospital in Lafayette (Indiana) is the first between these two institutions in Greater Lafayette.”
HemaChrome has received support from the U.S.-Korea Conference Startup Pitch Competition and the 2020 NIH Technology Accelerator Challenge. The company also has received support from Purdue Innovates and licenses technology through the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization.
HemaChrome introduces a simple mobile health solution that makes blood hemoglobin testing accessible and affordable for nearly everyone by using just what you already own – a smartphone or computer. Click on our mobile app and noninvasively measure your patient’s blood hemoglobin regardless of where they are – simply take live photos of on-site patients and screenshots over video calls for off-site patients. Instant and reliable results at a fraction of the cost, point-of-care and beyond.

Purdue University receives $21 million art donation of Degas sculptures from engineering alum Avrum Gray,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University has accepted a major collection of sculptures by prominent French impressionist artist Edgar Degas as a donation from Chicago businessman Avrum Gray (ME ’56).
The collection includes 74 bronze works and features “La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans (Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen),” one of the artist’s signature creations and most iconic works. Valued at more than $21 million with a market value of as much as $52 million, the collection represents the largest gift in the history of Purdue’s College of Liberal Arts.
“Art at Purdue will thrive as an essential dimension of a leading institution of higher learning,” said Purdue President Mung Chiang. “The visionary generosity from Av Gray brings the largest collection of Degas sculptures to our campus, and we are truly excited about the transformational impact to the creation of beauty by Boilermakers.”
After graduating from Purdue, Gray established a successful career in the automotive industry, money management and venture capitalism. He was honored with an Outstanding Mechanical Engineer Award in 2019.
Gray also began building his art collection soon after leaving the university, beginning with sculptures and works on paper from artists he liked. Approximately 14 years ago, Gray had the opportunity to purchase the Degas collection, which he displayed in his suburban Chicago home for more than a decade before deciding to downsize, which prompted him to donate the works to Purdue.
This is the second major gift Gray has made to the university. In 2006, Gray and his late wife Joyce established the Avrum and Joyce Gray Directorship in Purdue’s Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship.
“Purdue was very good to me in one way in particular: Purdue taught me a way to think,” Gray said. “I want people to enjoy (the sculptures) the way I have enjoyed them. I thought Purdue would be the place to do that. I was pleased to know Purdue was putting the collection on display and that it would bring to students an additional perspective of life and art that you just don’t get when you’re looking at gears and pulleys. I want people to be able to come, see, enjoy and learn.”
Known primarily as a painter, Degas created 150 small wax, clay and plaster sculptures that were discovered in his studio when he died in 1917. In fact, the only figurine cast during his lifetime was a plaster of the “Little Dancer.”
After the artist’s death, his heirs elected to commission bronzes of 73 of these figures plus the larger “Little Dancer,” which stands 39 inches high. In 1997–98, a foundry in Paris used these 1903 plaster molds to create the bronze pieces that Gray donated to Purdue.
An original “Little Dancer” and many of the other sculptures found in Degas’ studio are now housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Purdue University Galleries is assembling plans to showcase the complete Gray collection in one location for a full year. An exhibit and dedication are being planned for the fall, and additional details will be announced soon.
“In his lifetime, these sculptures were tools for Degas to inform his paintings,” said David A. Reingold, the Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts. “His way of working mirrors the way our STEM students prototype and build new products in their fields. By exposing all Purdue students to these works and another way of seeing the world, we can catalyze their growth as creative and innovative thinkers and problem solvers.”

You’ve got to have heart: Computer scientist works to help AI comprehend human emotions,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Bring up robot-human relations, and you’re bound to conjure images of famous futuristic robots, from the Terminator to C-3PO. But, in fact, the robot invasion has already begun. Devices and programs, including digital voice assistants, predictive text and household appliances, are smart, and getting smarter. It doesn’t do, though, for computers to be all brain and no heart.
Computer scientist Aniket Bera, an associate professor of computer science in Purdue University’s College of Science, is working to make sure the future is a little more “Big Hero 6” and a little less Skynet. From therapy chatbots to intuitive assistant robots to smart search and rescue drones to computer modeling and graphics, his lab works to optimize computers for a human world.
“The goal of my research is to use AI to improve human life,” Bera said. “Humans, human behavior and human emotions are at the center of everything I do.”
Bera is an expert in the interdisciplinary field of affective computing: using machine learning and other computer science methods to program artificial intelligence programs to better incorporate and understand human behavior and emotion.
Computers are tools, and they’re only as good as we program them to be. When you ask Siri to play a song or Alexa to set a timer, they respond to the context of your words. But humans don’t communicate using only words: Tone of voice, context, posture and gestures all play a monumentally important role in human communication.
“When a friend asks you how you are, you can say, ‘I’m fine!’ in an upbeat tone, and it means something completely different than if you say, ‘I’m fine,’ like Eeyore,” Bera said. “Computers usually just pay attention to the content and ignore the context.”
That literality is fine for devices that are merely trying to help you with mundane tasks. However, if you are using AI for more complex purposes, the devices need a little more of Captain Kirk’s outlook and a little less of Spock’s. Bera is using his expertise in machine learning to program devices to incorporate an understanding of nonverbal cues and communication.
“We are trying to build AI models and systems that are more humanlike and more adept at interacting with humans,” Bera said. “If we can maximize AI’s ability to interpret and interact with humans, we can help more people more efficiently.”
Bera and his team are working on a multisensory approach to this “emotional” AI, which involves observing and analyzing facial expressions, body language, involuntary and subconscious movements and gestures, eye movements, speech patterns, intonations and different linguistic and cultural parameters. Training AI on these sorts of inputs not only improves communication, it also better equips the AI to respond to humans in a more appropriate and even emotive manner.
Bera explains that the United States and most of the world are undergoing a shortage of mental health professionals. Access to mental health can be difficult to find, and sessions can be tough to afford or to fit into a person’s busy schedule. Bera sees emotionally intelligent AI programs as tools that might be able to bridge the gap, and he is working with medical schools and hospitals to bring these ideas to fruition.
AI-informed therapy programs could help assess a person’s mental and emotional health and point them toward correct resources, as well as suggest some initial strategies to help. Talking to an AI for some people, especially those who are neurodivergent or have social anxiety, may be lower stakes and easier than talking to a human. At the same time, having an AI assistant to take note of a person’s nonverbal communication and speech patterns can help human therapists track their patients’ progress between sessions and enable them to provide the best possible care.
Another area where enabling AI programs to better grasp human emotions is when robots share physical space with humans.
Self-driving cars can understand and interpret painted markers on the pavement, but they can’t identify human pedestrians and assess what they might do based on their movement.
A confused child, an angry adolescent or a panicking adult are all sights that might make a driver of a vehicle slow down and be more cautious than they might ordinarily be. The human driver knows intuitively that these are people who might make irrational or sudden moves and could put them at risk of collision with a vehicle.
For robots to be able to make that same conclusion using nonverbal and postural cues could help self-driving vehicles and other autonomous robots more safely navigate physical environments. Bera is working with collaborators on programming the brains of a wheeled robot called ProxEmo that can read humans’ body language to gauge their emotions.
In the future, similar protocols could help other types of robots assess which individuals in a crowd are confused or lost and help them quickly and efficiently.
Some physical environments – the scenes of natural disasters, battlefields and perilous environments – are too dangerous for humans. Historically, in those cases, humans have harnessed nonhuman partners, including coal mine canaries, rescue dogs and even bomb-sniffing rats, to go where no human can.
Of course, it would be even better if we could not risk any lives at all – not just spare the human ones. Bera and his team are working with commercially available drone models, like a four-footed robot “dog” – to create autonomous rovers that can, for example, search for survivors after an earthquake.
“Most people who die in the earthquake don’t die in the actual quake,” Bera said. “They die from being trapped in the rubble; they die because first responders couldn’t find them fast enough. A drone can scan the environment and crawl through debris to detect signs of life, including heartbeats, body heat and carbon dioxide, much more safely than even dogs can. Plus, there’s no risk to a living dog if we send in the robot dog.”
Understanding how humans move can help the robots navigate disaster scenes, stay out of the way of human first responders and help locate, reach and rescue survivors more efficiently than either humans or dogs could on their own. Think of Wall-E and EVE working together to restore the trashed planet Earth.
“The idea is to build a future where robots can be partners, can help humans accomplish goals and tasks more safely, more efficiently and more effectively,” Bera said. “In computer science, a lot of time the biggest problems are the humans. What our research does is put the human back into problem solving to build a better world.”

White Family Foundation commits $50 million to new Daniels School of Business at Purdue University,"summarize:The Dean and Barbara White Family Foundation has committed $50 million to Purdue University to name the undergraduate institute in the Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business.
This commitment represents the lead gift to establish the school and the largest monetary contribution ever made to Purdue’s School of Management/Business. The initiative to relaunch the School of Business, which began while Daniels was university president, will continue to be championed by new President Mung Chiang and the Board of Trustees.
The institute will be named the Bruce White Undergraduate Institute. White (M ’75), who died on Jan. 19, was founder and chairman of White Lodging, a former member of the Purdue Board of Trustees, and a longtime university benefactor.
“The White Family Foundation has long been a truly dedicated partner in helping Purdue achieve excellence at scale. The naming after Bruce White, one of the most prominent Boilermakers our university has ever known, is particularly meaningful to us,” Chiang said. “This gift ensures Purdue will educate exceptional undergraduate business students who will create and grow competitive businesses in a technology-driven, free-market economy.”
Announced in September 2022 as Purdue’s next big move in a decadelong series of major strategic investments, the new school will build on the rich heritage and historic strengths of the School of Management and Krannert Graduate School. This gift will help restructure and scale innovative degrees and provide transformational education experiences for undergraduate students.
The Bruce White Undergraduate Institute will serve as a flagship element of the Daniels School of Business. The Krannert name will be retained for the Krannert Graduate Institute. The new names of both institutes are subject to approval by the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees in the coming days.
“Purdue is recognized as a dynamic national leader in higher education, where it has redefined the meaning of value. As such, Purdue is seen as a strategic partner of our foundation,” said Bill Hanna, executive director of the White Family Foundation. “Bruce was an instrumental part of Purdue’s progress over the last decade and more, working closely with senior university leadership as both a trustee and a dedicated alum. He represents a true north that students can look to as a model, and the White Family Foundation is proud to support the Bruce White Undergraduate Institute.”
To create a revised curriculum that equips graduates to lead at the intersection of business and technology, the Daniels School will identify the best aspects of its top existing programs and build on the success of new degree pilots launched between fall 2021 and fall 2022.
These pilot programs include the integrated business and engineering (IBE) and business analytics programs. IBE launched with twice the number of expected students, and the new school’s goal is to grow the number of IBE and business analytics degree students to 1,600 — a full 40% of its undergraduate population.
Another successful new program, for a real estate finance minor, is, in fact, part of an earlier transformational commitment from the White Family Foundation. That gift, a $20.8 million commitment announced in April 2022, launched the Dean V. White Real Estate Finance program — and initiated conversations to reinvent the School of Management as a School of Business.
“The White Family Foundation’s commitment to an increasingly prominent Purdue inspired us to imagine a business school that addresses the need to reshape business education and produce technology-based graduates who build and lead successful companies,” Daniels said. “Their gifts provide tremendous momentum to realize our goals.”
Additional goals for the Daniels School include:
Increasing enrollment to 4,000 undergraduates and 2,000 graduate students by 2028.
Growing tenure-track and clinical faculty significantly this decade.
Adding additional square footage to current business facilities to accommodate program growth, with 2027 as the target move-in date.
Alumni and friends of Purdue have rallied to support the Daniels School of Business, committing more than $127 million so far to increase the school’s capacity for excellence at scale. The Board of Trustees has committed funds for the initiative, as well. An initial investment of $300 million will jump-start growth and establish Purdue’s program as the standard for an affordable, technology-focused, pro-business business education.
“The transformation of our business school is a huge part of our future as a university, and this gift is a testament to the legacies of Bruce White, the White family and Purdue,” said Mike Berghoff, chairman of the Purdue Board of Trustees. “We have always taken pride in how much we invest in our undergraduate students. This commitment reinforces our mission.”
The White family has been a prominent contributor to Purdue over the past three decades, including a combined gift of $30 million that helped transform the Union Club Hotel. The hotel serves as both the university’s boutique on-campus lodging option and a learning laboratory for students studying hospitality at Purdue.
“My brother Bruce was a phenomenal human being,” said Craig White, president of the board of trustees at the White Family Foundation. “His success in business was tremendous, but his success as a person and as a leader is even more impressive — he put his heart and soul into every aspect of his life, and he has inspired countless other people to do the same. Naming the undergraduate program after him couldn’t be more natural.”
Also, in 2021, Purdue renamed its hospitality and tourism school the White Lodging-J.W. Marriott, Jr. School of Hospitality and Tourism Management in honor of the company’s ongoing support and partnership.
“Bruce was a wonderful husband, father and friend,” Beth White said. “He was successful in his personal and business life because he was himself in all settings. Integrity was not just a word to Bruce; it was foundational. His values were matched by a tremendous drive to constantly improve in all aspects of life, to never accept the status quo and to have the courage to ask the tough questions — even of himself. When a leader like that shows up, things become dynamic. Everyone is inspired to give their best, and a journey toward excellence begins. Our family is very honored and pleased to know that the values and qualities Bruce lived by will be instilled and replicated in future generations of leaders who get their start at the Bruce White Undergraduate Institute.”

$10 million USDA grant to fuel economic resilience and sustainability in Eastern U.S. forests,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has awarded a $10 million grant to Purdue University to help landowners and stakeholders better adapt their forests to increasingly complicated economic and climate conditions in the Eastern U.S.
About five million small, private landowners control just over half the acreage of forests in the Eastern U.S. This contrasts with Western U.S. forests, which are mostly publicly owned. Purdue and its project partners—the University of Georgia, the University of Maine and the U.S. Forest Service—aim to improve the management of 15 million acres of those forests, an area nearly as large as the state of West Virginia.
The project encompasses the northern hardwood forest in the Northeast, the central hardwood region, and the southern pine and mixed hardwood.
“We will provide the digital tools that allow rapid response and precision management to improve forest health,” said Songlin Fei, a professor of forestry and natural resources and the Dean’s Chair of Remote Sensing at Purdue.
Called PERSEUS (Promoting Economic Resilience and Sustainability of the Eastern U.S. Forests), the project invokes the hero of Greek mythology who slew the fearsomely snake-haired Gorgon Medusa. In its modern incarnation, PERSEUS will work to protect forestry’s many benefits, which include timber and fiber production along with climate mitigation. Their long-term sustainability, however, faces threats from climate change, evolving markets and land-use changes.
“The high interest in carbon has renewed interest in forest, while complicating their overall management,” said Aaron Weiskittel, the Irving Chair of Forest Ecosystem Management at the University of Maine. “PERSEUS will work to provide a more holistic approach to forest management, while giving landowners new tools to guide decision-making.”
Partner institutions will add to the depth of the research, applying digital tools and artificial intelligence to a variety of areas and forest types. Working together, the team will explore ways to merge data collected from drones, satellites and other sources in an AI environment to automate forest inventories. They will also help build systems to analyze ecosystem services provided by forests, as well as the environmental footprint of the forestry supply chain.
“We need to provide research, extension and outreach products to benefit private forest landowners of the Eastern United States,” said Pete Bettinger, the project lead at the University of Georgia’s Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources. “And we need to design systems that improve the efficiency of data development and the accessibility of information related to alternative management options.”
PERSEUS is part of Purdue’s cross-disciplinary Center for Digital Forestry, which includes faculty members from the colleges of Agriculture, Engineering, Science and Liberal Arts; Purdue Libraries; and the Purdue Polytechnic Institute. As one of the five strategic investments in Purdue’s Next Moves, the center leverages digital technology and multidisciplinary expertise to measure, monitor and manage urban and rural forests to maximize social, economic and ecological benefits.
PERSEUS will guide landowner decision-making via a digital framework for visually representing current and future forest trends so that landowners will have data upon which to base their decisions.
“You could manage the same patch of forest for timber, carbon, wildlife or for something else.  Opportunities also come and go,” said Fei, who also directs the Center for Digital Forestry.
“We will provide different economic and environmentally friendly scenarios about the most beneficial way of managing it. This modeling approach is not just on your 20 or 50 acres. It’s put into context of the broader region.”
If too many landowners in an area begin planting loblolly pine or walnut trees, for example, that could reduce the profitability of their operations.
PERSEUS will pursue engaged climate-smart management to ensure the project’s success.
“Any on-the-ground impact requires stakeholder involvement and adoption of the practices and tools we develop. That is why we will use a co-production model, meaning that we will design tools and practices that are co-conceived by and acceptable to landowners but are also economical and environmentally friendly,” Fei said.
The project also will enhance the Center for Digital Forestry’s ongoing efforts to produce a digitally competent next-generation workforce.
“This is the future,” Fei said. “If the U.S. agricultural sector wants to stay competitive, we will need to put a lot of energy into this area.”",[{'summary_text': 'a $10 million grant will help landowners and stakeholders better adapt their forests to economic and climate conditions in the eastern u.s. the project invokes the hero of Greek mythology who slew the fearsomely snake-haired Gorgon Medusa.'}]
Purdue secures university-issued/subsidized devices through TikTok removal,"summarize:Dear Purdue University Employees,
This message is to announce that, effective Feb. 13, 2023, the TikTok app will not be permitted on university-issued/subsidized devices.
The university announced on Jan. 20 that all Purdue campuses, as well as Purdue Global, would no longer participate on the TikTok platform via institutional accounts. That decision was prompted by concerns about cybersecurity risks to user data privacy, algorithmic censorship of free speech, and threats to national security — all as stated publicly by the U.S. federal government.
Since TikTok is no longer used for university operations or activities, the policy announced today recognizes that the presence of TikTok on University-issued/subsidized devices is inconsistent with permitted uses of Purdue IT resources. As set forth in systemwide Policy VII.A.4 (Acceptable Use of IT Resources and Information Assets), the university makes IT resources available “(1) to support scholarship, research and instructional activities of University faculty, (2) to facilitate the operations of the University, (3) to provide access to University services and (4) to support student and campus life activities.” It follows that the use of an app with no connection to university content or activities is not a legitimate use of a university-provided IT resource.
In addition, the threats posed by TikTok to cybersecurity are unacceptable and unnecessary risks on devices that the university provides or subsidizes via the tech allowance.
All faculty, staff and student employees must immediately remove TikTok from university-issued/subsidized devices (including cell phones, laptops, tablets and desktop computers) in their care, custody or control.
Questions concerning this policy can be directed to  itap@purdue.edu.","[{'summary_text': 'effective Feb. 13, 2023, the TikTok app will not be permitted on university-issued/subsidized devices . the move was prompted by concerns about cybersecurity risks to user data privacy and algorithmic censorship of free speech .'}]"

Purdue Global Chancellor Dooley to appear on ‘The Balancing Act’,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Perhaps no television talk show is more appropriate for Purdue Global than “The Balancing Act.” After all, Purdue Global students — adult learners — stand out for their ability to successfully take classes while also holding down a job, caring for dependents and dealing with whatever life throws at them.
Purdue Global Chancellor Frank Dooley will appear on “The Balancing Act airing on Lifetime TV” at 7:30 a.m. ET and PT on Feb. 13 and Feb. 21. He is interviewed by Montel Williams, distinguished television host, actor, motivational speaker and U.S. Navy veteran.
“It was a pleasure visiting with Montel and an honor to share the Purdue Global story,” Dooley said. “We have such positive momentum with our university, and it’s important that we spread the word far and wide.”
In their eight-and-half-minute conversation, which was recorded in South Florida, Dooley and Williams discussed the importance of affordable online learning for adult learners. Between 25 and 40 million Americans have valuable life experience and some college credit, but no degree. They also talked about Purdue Global’s myriad certificate offerings for those individuals who have a degree and aspire to continue learning to upskill and grow their careers.
“Working adults often need access to more education, and Purdue Global provides that to them,” said Dooley, noting that the university’s most popular programs — among the more than 175 offered — are cybersecurity, information technology, nursing, criminal justice and applied behavioral analysis. “They want to earn a degree they can be proud of and one that employees will respect.”
Dooley explained that Purdue Global courses feature lectures, discussion boards, seminars — and plenty of student support for those who need it. Courses are taught by skilled faculty members armed with educational technology and enhanced delivery methods to make classes easy to access and navigate.
“I like that Montel used the phrase ‘life gets in the way’ when talking about adults going to school, because that’s a really accurate depiction of life,” Dooley said. “We believe Purdue Global is the perfect place for them.”
Williams spent 22 years in the U.S. Navy, and Purdue Global is a military-friendly school for both current and retired members. Dooley cited Kelvin Gumbs, a Navy veteran who earned two Purdue Global degrees. Gumbs provided the keynote address at the October 2022 commencement ceremony and now works for the university as it strives to do an even better job serving the military.
Purdue Global delivers personalized online education tailored to the unique needs of adults who have work or life experience beyond the classroom, enabling them to develop essential academic and professional skills with the support and flexibility they need to achieve their career goals.

"Food survey queries consumers about New Year’s resolutions, risk tolerance","summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Eating more fruits and vegetables and less sugar ranked highly as potential changes to eating behaviors related to New Year’s resolutions, according to the January Consumer Food Insights Report. This month’s report also summarizes and discusses the state of the survey indicators after one full year of data collection.
The survey-based report out of Purdue University’s Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability assesses food spending, consumer satisfaction and values, support of agricultural and food policies, and trust in information sources. Purdue experts conducted and evaluated the survey, which included 1,200 consumers across the U.S.
“People are generally knowledgeable about the actions needed to improve health and want to pursue them – such as increasing fruits and vegetables and exercising more,” said Jayson Lusk, the department head and Distinguished Professor of Agricultural Economics at Purdue who leads the center. “However, they don’t necessarily want to give up on taste and indulgences. For example, eating less meat or drinking less alcohol is low on the list of priorities of most Americans.”
As the Consumer Food Insights Report has noted previously, food spending is up significantly — 19% — from a year ago. Grocery spending, however, has remained effectively flat for the past six months.
“It appears that people have already cut back and found deals to help stop their food spending from continually rising,” Lusk said. “If food inflation does not come down significantly this year, consumers might not have much room to maneuver their budgets further.”
Those surveyed estimated that current inflation is up more than 1 percentage point from last month. But the survey results show that people seem to remain optimistic about inflation declining dramatically over the next year.
Additional key results include:
Food insecurity is unchanged from January 2022, but a decline in households visiting food pantries raises further questions.
Americans report being neither risk averse nor risk loving but are slightly more cautious with regards to their health.
Trust in the USDA and US Department of Health and Human Services’ Dietary Guidelines for Americans is at an all-time high as its advisory committee prepares to discuss 2025 guidelines.
A large majority of people want to increase funding and technical support to agricultural producers.
Despite price increases, the rate of national food insecurity again shows surprising consistency from last January, said Sam Polzin, a food and agriculture survey scientist for the center and co-author of the report.
“In fact, we have even seen a continued decline in the share of households who say they have received free food from a pantry this month,” Polzin said. “Given the current high-price environment, it is hard to believe that fewer people need help from the charitable food system. We might ask if there are fewer charitable food resources available now or if people are having a harder time accessing them.”
Overall, the sustainable food purchasing index continues to show consistency. But as the “taste” and “economic” aspects of the index remain strong, the ongoing weakness of the environment and social indicators is discouraging from the sustainability perspective, Polzin noted.
Behaviors like “choosing plant-based proteins over animal proteins” are rare. Similarly, beliefs like “agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change” are held by a minority.
“We might say that food system sustainability does not concern consumers as much as some advocates might want it. We saw little change on this front in our survey over the course of 2022,” Polzin said.
As for risk-taking, Americans generally consider themselves to be middle-of-the road in daily life, scoring 5.4 on a 0 to 10 (risk averse to risk loving) scale. They rated their risk tolerance regarding their health generally about one point lower, 4.3. But when it comes to food consumption, their risk tolerance is 5.2 for “food consumed at home,” and 5.1 for “away from home.”
Lusk further discusses the report in his blog.
The Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability is part of Purdue’s Next Moves in agriculture and food systems and uses innovative data analysis shared through user-friendly platforms to improve the food system. In addition to the Consumer Food Insights Report, the center offers a portfolio of online dashboards.

New success coaches to help Purdue Global students with life challenges,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Courtney Brinkman recently took a call from a Purdue Global student who needed food for her family. From her home office in Attica, Indiana, Brinkman helped the student find local resources, including a food bank.
The call Brinkman took is part of her rigorous training as a member of Purdue Global’s first cohort of six student success coaches. The four-week training covers Purdue Global policies, as well as how to address a variety of situations that students could reach out about when seeking assistance.
Success coaching — an emerging role in higher education that focuses on a relational approach to student success — is part of Purdue Global’s overall goal of providing more intensive support to the school’s adult learner population.
“When our students struggle, it is not because they are unable to do the work academically; it is because their complex lives are getting in the way,” says Karen McGregor, executive director of Purdue Global’s student success coaching program. “We believe that the addition of success coaching will enable us to walk alongside our students and help them to navigate the ups and downs of life and thrive at Purdue Global.”
The goal is to expand the program and have 24 success coaches by July 1. As success coaches are added, McGregor says it is important to know what they can and cannot address. They aren’t tutors or academic advisors.
“They will sit at the intersection of a lot of existing services and help make sure students are accessing experts at the right time,” McGregor says. “In addition, they will be building a skill set that is outside the services currently offered to help students stabilize their lives in times of personal and academic crisis. This might mean helping a student access tutoring or other academic services offered by Purdue Global, mental health support, or a local food bank.”
McGregor, who has worked with adult learners in the past, says having a strong support network is important for student success.
“Some students have a strong support system, while others might not,” McGregor says. “Success coaching allows us to truly support students who otherwise might have to go it alone.”
The Purdue Global success coaching program is based on work done with similar student coaching programs at Purdue University. At its main flagship campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, Purdue utilizes peer success coaches, student coaches and online success coaches.
The first six success coaches will also make a behind-the-scenes difference by designing processes, tools and practices, as well as helping identify the barriers students face.
Ashley Flood, manager of the student success coaches, says it was important to know about the challenges Purdue Global students face and how the success coaches could provide support.
Coaches have a variety of experiences, including academic advising, nonprofit organizations, success coaching, residential life, recruitment and psychology.
“I would say all of them are absolutely skilled in working with students and bringing compassion and understanding to the conversations,” Flood says. “Their experience also makes me confident in their abilities to think of creative solutions to challenges that may arise.”

Speaking stones: Analyzing Antarctica’s rocks to explore Earth’s past and possible futures.,"summarize:Info for journalists
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The standard image of Antarctica is vast, featureless sheets of ice and blowing blizzards. But soaring rocky mountains with deep valleys cut like a knife into the continent of Antarctica, evoking the lavish landscapes of the American Southwest’s Monument Valley. Here, ancient rocks reach for the cold blue sky, and here is where Marissa Tremblay, assistant professor of earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences in Purdue University’s College of Science, led her team of science experts – all of whom happen to be women.
Their goal in traveling to what is essentially the ends of the Earth was to look far into the past of Antarctica’s climate history. Researchers have long examined ice cores to understand the climate history of Antarctica, but that research can go only as far back as the oldest ice they can access.
To dig deeper into the past – to learn more about some of Earth’s warm periods, when Antarctica lost much of its ice – scientists need to look to the rocks.
Tremblay is a noble gas geochemist who has pioneered a new way of looking at rocks and analyzing what temperatures they have experienced using tiny amounts of noble gas inside the rock. She has already used this technique to study climate history in the European Alps and other places, and she hopes that Antarctic rocks will tell an even older story, taking a deeper dive into ancient history.
“One of the most exciting things about this trip – other than the trip itself – is the possibility of revealing how warm the Antarctic continent was before our oldest ice core records,” Tremblay said. “Understanding what Antarctica, and the Earth, looked like in the past can help us peer into and predict potential futures.”
Tremblay and her team trekked into Antarctica’s remote McMurdo Dry Valleys to sample rocks and record the weather, temperature and atmospheric conditions at a number of sites. The rocks here, at one of the driest and most remote places on Earth, are devoid of ice. They have been exposed to the atmosphere, and almost nothing else, for millions of years.
The team included Tremblay’s doctoral student Emily Apel, who is focusing on this research as part of her dissertation; geologist Jennifer Lamp of Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who oversaw the weather and temperature instruments; and geochemist Marie Bergelin of the Berkeley Geochronology Center, who sampled rocks and helped install the instruments.
The rock samples they collected are being sent in cold storage on a ship to Tremblay’s lab at Purdue. Once they arrive, she will use her unique expertise to analyze the samples and conduct more detailed research alongside Darryl Granger, Purdue geologist and professor of earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences.
“Three to 3.3 million years ago, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were similar to today, and sea levels were 50 feet or more higher – about the height of a five-story building!” Tremblay said. “This required the entire Greenland ice sheet to have melted, as well as a significant portion of the Antarctic ice sheets. Today, ice sheets cover most of Antarctica, but they are vulnerable to climate change. But just how vulnerable are they, and how much will they contribute to sea level rise as our planet continues to warm? Those are the questions we’re hoping to answer with this new research.”

"Arvind Raman selected as the next dean of Purdue’s College of Engineering, the largest top-ranked program in the nation","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Longtime Purdue University administrator, faculty member and Boilermaker alumnus Arvind Raman is the new John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering.
Raman, currently Purdue’s executive associate dean of engineering and the Robert V. Adams Professor in Mechanical Engineering, brings an impressive record of academic leadership experience to this new role, Patrick Wolfe, Purdue provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity, said in making the announcement today (Feb. 6).
“Professor Raman is passionate about the role of engineering in creating innovative solutions for people and society. We’re confident that as our next engineering dean, he will lead the college to new levels of excellence and impact,” Wolfe said.
Starting April 1, Raman succeeds Mark Lundstrom, the Don and Carol Scifres Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who has served as interim dean of the college since July 1, 2022. After April 1, Lundstrom will continue to lead the semiconductors activities across Purdue and its representation in statewide efforts as a senior advisor to the president and chief semiconductor officer.
Raman and Julie Swann, the A. Doug Allison Distinguished Professor and department head of the Edward P. Fitts Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at North Carolina State University, were the two finalists selected by the university’s search advisory committee to make on-campus presentations and hold Q&A sessions the week of Jan. 16.
Out of many strong applicants, the search committee first interviewed 10 semifinalists in December, including a sitting provost, senior associate deans of top engineering colleges, and heads of large departments in AAU universities.
Purdue’s undergraduate and graduate engineering programs are among the top 10 and top five in the country, according to the last two years of the U.S. News and World Report college rankings. Roughly 30% of Purdue undergraduates are enrolled in the engineering college.
In his role as executive associate dean since December 2019, Raman has led activities aimed at recruiting excellent and diverse faculty talent, enhancing the success of faculty and staff programs, elevating the prestige of Purdue engineering, and supporting the overall quality of academic programs and faculty development. He also oversaw the offices of graduate and undergraduate education. Prior, he was the inaugural associate dean for global engineering programs, where, within three years, he helped more than double the number of international experiences taken by engineering students, and established new partnerships in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and Asia.
Raman said it’s an especially exciting time for Purdue and engineering, as Mung Chiang, predecessor to Mark Lundstrom, begins his term as Purdue president and Provost Wolfe is coming into his role after serving five years as dean of Purdue College of Science. He also notes the transformative development underway for Purdue’s presence in Indianapolis and the momentum from a decade of unprecedented success and growth for engineering and across the Purdue campus.
“The College of Engineering, in partnership with our faculty, students, staff, alumni and industry partners, is poised for excellence at scale and the promise to pursue and lead truly game-changing initiatives that will impact the state, nation and world,” Raman said. “It is truly an honor to be selected to lead the nation’s largest top-ranked college of engineering at a university with a tremendous legacy and a record of innovation and impact on a global scale.”
Raman was named a Purdue University Faculty Scholar from 2008-12 and a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 2012. He also has a courtesy professorship appointment in materials engineering.
His research interests are in nonlinear dynamics and its applications to atomic force microscopy, human biomechanics, and roll-to-roll flexible electronics manufacturing. In addition, he is co-founder of the Shah Family Global Innovation Lab, which has supported over 30 faculty-led technology development and scale-up projects with top nongovernmental organizations for sustainable development.
He also served as director of the USAID-funded LASER (Long-term Assistance and SErvices for Research) PULSE (Partners for University-Led Solutions Engine) consortium, leading the five-year, $70 million program. Through its partners Catholic Relief Services, Indiana University, Makerere University and the University of Notre Dame, LASER delivered research-driven solutions to field-sourced development challenges in USAID (United States Agency for International Development) partner countries.
Raman is a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and an ASME Gustus Larson Memorial Award recipient, as well as a Keeley fellow (Oxford), College of Engineering outstanding young investigator awardee, and a National Science Foundation CAREER awardee. Through the Purdue-led nanoHUB, Raman’s atomic force microscopy simulation tools are used by thousands of researchers worldwide.
He received his PhD in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, a master’s degree, also in mechanical engineering, from Purdue and a Bachelor of Technology degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi.
Under Dean Chiang’s leadership, Purdue’s College of Engineering achieved record levels in undergraduate admissions selectivity, yield rate and graduation rate, as well as enrollment of women and underrepresented minorities. Meantime, the college’s online program size more than quadrupled while its ranking advanced to the top three in the nation. Additionally, new degrees were launched, and the professional master’s program’s enrollment more than quadrupled. Annual research awards surged over 70%, including the largest federal and the largest industry funding awards in college history, and 12 national research centers. The college also contributed to Purdue’s Ever True campaign in excess of $1 billion and completed 15 facility construction or renovation projects over the past six years.
The Search Advisory Committee for the new engineering dean was co-chaired by Sasha Boltasseva, the Ron and Dotty Garven Tonjes Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Dan DeLaurentis, vice president for research institutes and centers in Discovery Park District at Purdue and professor of aeronautics and astronautics.
Additional search committee members were Barrett Caldwell, professor of industrial engineering; Luciano Castillo, the Kenninger Professor of Renewal Energy and Power Systems in Mechanical Engineering; Panagiota Karava, the Jack and Kay Hockema Professor in Civil Engineering; Sangtae Kim, Distinguished Professor and the Jay and Cynthia Ihlenfeld Head of Chemical Engineering; Bill Oakes, the 150th Anniversary Professor of Engineering Education; Chi Hwan Lee, the Leslie A. Geddes Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering; Morgan Broberg, graduate student, civil engineering; and Christine Babick, director of communications for the College of Engineering.

These defined interests, spurred by an increasingly connected world and a rapidly changing microelectronics landscape, will centralize long-term, pathfinding research aimed at breakthroughs applicable across defense and academia.”
Purdue faculty, all representing the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), will take on lead research roles and lend expertise in semiconductors and hard artificial intelligence to two of the centers, in which investment totals $65.7 million. Both multi-university centers are led by Georgia Institute of Technology.
“Semiconductors and AI are technologies fundamentally reshaping our world and the future of humanity. Purdue is leading the nation in advancing these technologies through transformative investments, research and workforce development powered by our world-class faculty and students,” Purdue President Mung Chiang said. “We are happy to continue our leadership through the SRC JUMP 2.0 program.”
In the Center for the Co-Design of Cognitive Systems (CoCoSys), Anand Raghunathan, Silicon Valley Professor in ECE, is the Purdue principal investigator and associate director. Purdue co-PIs are Kaushik Roy, the Edward G. Tiedemann Jr. Distinguished Professor in ECE; Vijay Raghunathan, ECE professor and director of semiconductor education; and Sumeet Gupta, ECE associate professor.
In the Center on Cognitive Multispectral Sensors (CogniSense), Vijay Raghunathan is the Purdue PI and leader of one of the center’s research themes, and Stanley Chan, ECE associate professor, is the Purdue co-PI.
“The Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue has a rich history of leadership in SRC-funded research. We are excited that our faculty are key contributors to these new centers that will strongly impact the future of cognitive sensing and computing systems,” said Dimitri Peroulis, the Michael and Katherine Birck Head and Reilly Professor in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
CoCoSys’s vision is to enable seamless human-AI collaboration. The next wave of AI will impact everyday lives through collaborative intelligent systems such as digital humans and collaborative robots. These systems will drive unprecedented levels of automation, amplify human capabilities and fundamentally reshape the nature of work, personal life and the human experience itself. CoCoSys researchers will enable human-AI systems through synergistic advances in neuro-symbolic-probabilistic algorithms, technology-driven hardware motifs, algorithm-hardware co-design and collective and collaborative intelligence.
CogniSense addresses the demand for high-quality unobstructed perception for the safe operation of emerging autonomous systems. Current sensing technologies generate unmanageable data volumes and consume too much power. The center’s vision is to develop cognitive multispectral sensors that directly generate trustworthy insight from wideband multimodal analog signals. By designing sensors that dynamically adapt to “what is being sensed” and “how sensed signals are processed” according to real-time changes in the environment, CogniSense research is projected to dramatically reduce the volume of data produced by these sensors.
In 2018, as part of the SRC/DARPA JUMP 1.0 program, Purdue was selected to lead the Center for Brain-inspired Computing Enabling Autonomous Intelligence (C-BRIC). The $35-million center’s mission is to deliver key advances in cognitive computing, with the goal of enabling a new generation of autonomous intelligent systems.

Purdue trustees endorse 12th consecutive tuition freeze,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
The Purdue University Board of Trustees on Friday (Feb. 3) endorsed President Mung Chiang’s request for a 12th consecutive tuition freeze, meaning students will see no increase in tuition through at least the 2024-25 academic year.
To be formally approved by the trustees in late spring per state statute, after the legislative budget setting, base undergraduate tuition at Purdue West Lafayette will remain at $9,992 per year for Indiana residents and $28,794 for out-of-state students through 2024-25.
The total cost of attending Purdue continues to be less today than in 2012, with tuition held flat and lower room and board rates. The tuition freeze saves students over $150 million per year for a cumulative total of over a billion dollars, compared to if Purdue had instituted annual increases at the Big Ten average, and debt per undergraduate student has declined 36% since 2012. By 2024-25, 10 graduating classes will have never experienced a tuition increase during their time at Purdue.
At the same time, more students than ever are seeking a Purdue degree – more than 71,000 applied for admission for Fall 2023 – and more employers than ever are seeking out Purdue graduates. Last fall, total enrollment reached a record 50,884 students and marked the university’s eighth straight record high. That total includes 37,949 undergrads – also a record.
“Purdue remains committed to the vision of higher education with the highest proven value,” Chiang said. “This proposal of another year of tuition freeze, and the endorsement by the Board of Trustees, continues Purdue’s national leadership in student access and success.”
In addition to the growing number of applicants for enrollment from across the country, evidence of Purdue’s enhanced national profile include being the only university named a “Brand That Matters” by Fast Company magazine in both 2021 and 2022, a No. 4 ranking as the most trusted public university in the country and a top 3 ranking as a university that protects free speech and open inquiry. U.S. News & World Report has ranked Purdue as one of the most innovative schools in the country each of the last five years in addition to ranking numerous academic programs highly.
President Emeritus Mitch Daniels first announced that Purdue would not increase tuition in Spring 2013, shortly after he became the university’s 12th president. Before that, Purdue tuition had increased every year since 1976, and it rose an average of nearly 6% annually from 2002-12.

"Purdue’s next big move: The Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue’s next big move in a decadelong series of major strategic investments will honor a celebrated president who led transformative change during his tenure, as plans for the state-of-the-art Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. School of Business were approved Friday (Feb. 3) by the university’s Board of Trustees. The reimagined Daniels School will prepare tomorrow’s leaders and entrepreneurs, grounding them in the hallmarks of a Purdue education, including STEM disciplines and business analytics.
“To be associated with any aspect of Purdue’s academic enterprise is an inestimable honor, but this one in particular touches me deeply,” said Daniels, Purdue’s 12th president, who retired from the role in December. “Practiced with integrity, business careers are the noblest of life choices; they create new jobs and wealth for others and bring into being the resources which the public and nonprofit sectors take to pursue their goals. This modernized School of Business will send out its graduates armed with a sense of mission and the tools to fulfill that mission in the most complex of enterprises.”
This announcement (see YouTube video) marks the first time Purdue’s business school will have a formal name. The board committed to retaining the Krannert name, long associated with the school’s graduate offerings since the naming began, for its graduate and executive degree programs within the newly named Daniels School.
Charting a new course for business education, the Daniels School will be marked by graduates who embody the values of wisdom and creativity, grounded in a firm grasp of today’s technologies and their likely evolution; who are aware of the history of progress that freedom of enterprise has created and continues to advance; and who are trained to lead and inspire others with strength and decisiveness. The reimagined Daniels School will instill these values and qualities, preparing each graduate as they leave Purdue to found and lead businesses and be the successful entrepreneurs and industry leaders of tomorrow.
The new name not only celebrates Daniels’ acclaimed tenure as Purdue president, but also his highly reputed business acumen in the private sector. Before his time at Purdue, Daniels held several top executive posts in an 11-year career at Eli Lilly and Company, including president of Eli Lilly’s North American pharmaceutical operations and senior vice president for corporate strategy and policy. Fortunes soared during Daniels’ tenure, his longest in any role in his professional life, as part of the leadership team that saw assets, revenue and income more than double. He also has served as CEO of the Hudson Institute, which is a major contract research organization, and on the boards of a number of public and private companies, including Penske Entertainment, Norfolk Southern Corp. and Interactive Intelligence.
As the 49th governor of Indiana, Daniels transformed the nearly $800 million deficit he inherited into an annual surplus of $370 million within a year. Daniels reduced the state’s overall debt by 40% and left Indiana with a budget surplus, reserve funds equal to nearly 15% of annual spending and its first AAA credit rating. The public-private Indiana Economic Development Corp., Daniels’ first legislative success while in office, broke previous records for creating new jobs in the state and was associated with more than $18 billion of new investment. In 2008 Site Selection Magazine and CNBC both named Indiana the nation’s Most Improved State for Business. Thanks to the turnaround under the Daniels administration, Indiana has enjoyed favorable national rankings of business attractiveness and job creation to this day.
“President Emeritus Mitch Daniels is regarded as the most innovative university president in America, and his private sector business leadership is as outstanding as his public service. It is truly fitting and exciting to place his name upon this impactful growth to the Purdue landscape,” said Mung Chiang, Purdue’s 13th president. “Through the launch of the Daniels School of Business, Purdue will have a world-class business school that carries out even more top-caliber research and educates many future leaders of a technology-driven, free market economy.”
The advances of science across almost all economic sectors have created a clear need for a future crop of business leaders who fully understand not only the data in front of them, but also from where the next breakthrough may come. At the Daniels School, students will master the skills of gathering big data and using it to drive business decisions to become the most valuable working professionals of today and tomorrow. This transformation will be rooted in preeminence in business analytics and degrees that blend business with technology, which will enable Purdue to scale innovation.
Capitalizing on the momentum of a 33% enrollment increase since 2019, bucking the trend of declines in college-going rates nationwide, the Daniels School of Business relaunches with ambitious plans to increase the undergraduate student body significantly, double the enrollment of the graduate school, and significantly add to the facility’s physical size through expansion and renovation. The initial phase will also include attracting large cohorts of preeminent faculty and national thought leaders, as well as curricular and experiential education additions. With excellence at scale, the Daniels School positions Purdue to become a world leader in business education and a top 10 business school, with its graduates uniquely prepared to bring discoveries to the marketplace and scale up innovations.
The Daniels School will build upon Purdue’s mission as a land-grant university to provide affordable and accessible education while combining technological excellence and business expertise. Some of that foundation has already been established with Purdue’s recently inaugurated Integrated Business and Engineering degree; its highly ranked business analytics programs; the new Dean V. White Real Estate Finance program; and the Larsen Leaders Academy, further propelled by a $10 million gift from Marshall and Susan Larsen. The Larsen gift was celebrated last fall to create a competitive advantage for students entering business.
Mike Berghoff, chair of Purdue’s Board of Trustees, said Purdue will invest a minimum of $100 million into the relaunch, along with a fundraising campaign of $200 million from loyal donors, underlining the determined commitment to making the Daniels School of Business one of the foremost business schools in the nation through new academic programs, innovative learning opportunities and top-notch faculty recruits.
Historically, Purdue has celebrated many graduates who have become CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, with eight alumni currently serving in that role as measured by Academic Influence. The move toward the Daniels School of Business further builds on a standard of excellence at scale at Purdue, beginning with the College of Engineering, where both the graduate and undergraduate degree programs are ranked among the top in the nation by U.S. News & World Report (4th and 9th, respectively).
Purdue was the only university selected by Fast Company as a “Brand That Matters” in 2022, earning the distinction for the second consecutive year. Purdue was also named America’s No. 4 most trusted public university by Morning Consult. It has been recognized as a top 10 public university by the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education and a top 10 Most Innovative University for five years straight by U.S. News & World Report.

Chancellor Dooley updates trustees on Purdue Global Moves,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Chancellor Frank Dooley on Friday (Feb. 3) provided the Purdue Global Board of Trustees with an update on Purdue Global Moves during its public meeting.
Purdue Global Moves, announced in June 2021, are four strategic initiatives designed to help the university meet its goals of results, growth and innovation. Purdue Global Moves are motivated by and closely aligned with Purdue University’s Next Moves. Three of the moves – Professional Skills, Classroom of the Future and Student Success – tie to the Purdue University Next Move Transformative Education 2.0. The fourth Purdue Global move focuses on Equity.
Professional Skills: Assess and track professional skills sought by employers and attained through education, training, work and concurrent experiences. Purdue Global is updating its professional skills report, working with Google on skills tracking and working with business-to-business partners to assess what this means in practice.
Classroom of the Future: Provide accessible, flexible and innovative online learning at scale. Purdue Global is working with Purdue University on this move and with Google in AI, machine learning and YouTube, and has created an Association of College and University Educators faculty development program as well as a new roadmap for its next-generation teaching and learning experience.
Student Success: Improve outcomes by enhancing student success support along the entire student journey. Purdue Global launched a beta emergency cash grant program, developed a roadmap for a new student success model, hired Karen McGregor as executive director of student success and a team of student success coaches, and created a secure virtual student peer community called GetSet.
Equity Task Force: Ensure equitable opportunities for all. Purdue Global, which works closely with the Purdue University Equity Task Force, hired Tiffany G. Townsend as vice president of organizational culture/chief diversity officer, participated in the Equity in Retention Academy and added Juneteenth as an observed university holiday.
Dooley also highlighted the work of R. Ethan Braden, executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer for Purdue University and Purdue Global, and Nathan Utz, vice president, Office of Industry Partnerships for Purdue University and Purdue University Global.
Under Braden, Purdue Global will launch a new brand campaign on April 3, reflecting a change in marketing strategy based on brand building. Dooley explained that the shift from conversion spending to brand building may lead to a short-term enrollment dip, but will lead to a long-term lift in enrollment.
Utz supports a holistic and integrated approach to relationships with industry partners – managing existing pipeline and sales operation – and coordination with all sales representatives, including Guild.
In addition, Purdue Global trustee Paul Bott updated the board on a committee formed in December 2022 to evaluate current practices and recommend actions necessary to comply with the proposed Higher Learning Commission policy change on recruiting, admissions and related enrollment practices – including with respect to support functions currently provided by Kaplan Inc. That committee, which consists of board members Neil Hoyne, Mike Klipsch and Bott (chair), is continuing its work. The next step will be for a Purdue Global team to analyze operational requirements to comply with recommended changes.
Purdue Global delivers personalized online education tailored to the unique needs of adults who have work or life experience beyond the classroom, enabling them to develop essential academic and professional skills with the support and flexibility they need to achieve their career goals. It offers personalized paths for students to earn an associate, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, based on their work experience, desired pace, military service, previous college credits and other considerations – no matter where they are in their life journey. Purdue Global is a nonprofit, public university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It is affiliated with Purdue University’s flagship institution, a highly ranked public research university located in West Lafayette, Indiana.

"Purdue researchers receive over $143,000 to strengthen marketplace interest in their IP","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University innovators who create new processes and products need capital, among other resources, to bring their ideas to reality. A Purdue fund is making financial support available to help them further develop their work.
Researchers from the College of Agriculture and College of Engineering have received more than $143,000 from the Trask Innovation Fund to make their work more attractive for commercial use. The fund is managed by the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization. It awards up to $50,000 for short-term projects that enhance the commercial value of intellectual property. The application deadline for the next round of funding is Feb. 17.
Brooke Beier, Purdue Research Foundation’s senior vice president of commercialization, said researchers need funding to bridge the “valley of death” between creating innovations and advancing them to market.
“PRF recognizes that funding and other resources assist innovators and entrepreneurs in developing products viable for industry commercialization,” Beier said. “The Trask Innovation Fund complements the other resources provided under the Purdue Innovates brand.”
Abhijit Karve, the Office of Technology Commercialization’s director of business development, said recipients have used Trask Innovation Fund awards in several ways.
“Often, companies want additional validation of the technology before they can license it. Trask Innovation Fund awards have been used to develop prototypes, conduct tests, support students and generate data,” Karve said. “These steps add another round of validation for these researchers’ work and make it more attractive for the marketplace.”
Trask Innovation Fund recipients, their project and award amounts are:
Jian Jin, College of Agriculture and College of Engineering, “PhenoBee: A Drone-Based Robot System for Single Leaf Scan with LeafSpec in the Soybean Field,” $25,000.
Mohsen Mohammadi, College of Agriculture, “Efficient Genotype-Independent In-Planta Transformation of Wheat,” $47,773.
Xiulin Ruan, College of Engineering, “Durable and Water-Based Radiative Cooling Paints,” $48,681.
Gyeong Mee Yoon, College of Agriculture, “Constitutive Nuclear Targeting of CTR1 (CNTC) as a Genetic Tool to Confer a Drought Tolerant Trait to Soybeans,” $25,000.
Jin said researchers in his laboratory have been developing new sensing technology for next-generation plant phenotyping, which shows how genetics and the environment impact a plant’s characteristics and a crop’s yield performance.
“The newly awarded Trask funding will test PhenoBee, our new phenotyping drone robot, in the field and collect data to validate its accuracy and throughput for potential commercial applications,” Jin said. “We hope through this project we will be able to prove PhenoBee provides unprecedented crop phenotyping quality for earlier nutrients and disease detection based on the featured LeafSpec technology.”
A video of a PhenoBee technology demonstration is available online.
Mohammadi said his team’s innovation enables fast-track genome editing and trait development to create wheat varieties that address challenges like salinity, drought, heat stress, diseases and pests.
“We will use this funding to evaluate the inheritance of traits to next generations and the applicability of the technique to develop better agronomic traits,” Mohammadi said.
Ruan said his research team has created ultrawhite radiative cooling paints that can cool below the ambient temperature under direct sunlight without consuming power.
“We will use the Trask award to further develop the paints and improve the readiness of the technology for market,” Ruan said. “The paint formulations will be optimized to enable anti-soiling hydrophobic surfaces and minimize the amount of volatile organic compound (VOC), resulting in formulations that will be durable and water-based radiative cooling paints.”
Yoon said their CNTC technology enhances plant stress responses by modulating the hormone ethylene. She said the funding will be used to develop drought-tolerant soybean plants.
“The success of this project will not only provide new drought-tolerant soybean genotypes, but also improve our understanding of how plant hormones regulate stress responses in crops,” Yoon said. “It could potentially be applied to other important crops such as maize and rice.”

Purdue a factor as Lafayette No. 1 nationally in latest WSJ/Realtor.com housing index of most affordable markets for fourth quarter,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Think the burgeoning Discovery Park District at Purdue is benefiting only Purdue University?
Not the case. It’s helping grow the Greater Lafayette economy and bringing new jobs, leading to a comparatively affordable housing market and a skilled, technology-based workforce.
Lafayette is ranked No. 1 in the latest Wall Street Journal/Realtor.com Emerging Housing Market Index, winter 2023. Purdue’s presence is a significant factor.
The WSJ/Realtor.com fourth-quarter rankings, released Tuesday (Jan. 31), show Lafayette in the No. 1 spot, followed by two other Indiana communities – Fort Wayne and Elkhart. Topeka, Kansas, and Johnson City, Tennessee, round out the top five.
The index identifies the top metro areas for homebuyers seeking an appreciating housing market, strong local economy and appealing lifestyle amenities, according to the story. News Corp., parent company of the Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.
Working with state and local leaders, Purdue has helped position the university and Greater Lafayette to become a national leader in the semiconductor industry. In December, university and local officials announced a Purdue-led project that will receive $5 million in funding through a Greater Lafayette economic development initiative to support expected regional workforce demand in the promising semiconductor manufacturing industry. In the announcement, Purdue and Greater Lafayette officials revealed the seven regional READI (Indiana’s Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative) projects that would share $30 million in total funding.
The Discovery Park District at Purdue includes the likes of Saab, Rolls-Royce, major facilities and partnerships in hypersonics, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Wabash, MediaTek and others in the district, among the most attractive and innovative environments in the Midwest.
It all fits with the $1 billion district’s mixed-use development of housing, high-end manufacturing, and industry and research-driven partnerships. The live-work-play community is for families, young professionals and retirees excited about living near a university community and the vibrancy of its culture.
West Lafayette has a No. 8 ranking for the Best College Towns & Cities in America. In compiling its 2022 list, WalletHub gauged 415 communities across three key areas: wallet friendliness, social environment, and academic and economic opportunities.
Purdue has helped lure people to the area through its Work from Purdue initiative, a program inviting people who work remotely to live in Discovery Park District at Purdue for its available affordable housing and the collaborative, invigorating energy of a campus with the flexibility of remote work.
According to the WSJ/Realtor.com story, the December median home-sale price in Tippecanoe County, which includes Lafayette, was $243,000. That was up 13% from a year earlier, according to the Indiana Association of Realtors, but it was still more than $100,000 below the national median existing-home sales price of $366,900 for the same period.

"The moon is too hot and too cold; now it could be just right for humans, thanks to newly available science","summarize:Info for journalists
With temperatures on the moon ranging from minus 410 to a scorching 250 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s an understatement to say that humans will need habitats with heat and air conditioning to survive there long term.
But heating and cooling systems won’t be effective enough to support habitats for lunar exploration or even longer trips to Mars without an understanding of what reduced gravity does to boiling and condensation. Engineers haven’t been able to crack this science – until now.
“Every refrigerator, every air conditioning system we have on Earth involves boiling and condensation. Those same mechanisms are also prevalent in numerous other applications, including steam power plants, nuclear reactors and both chemical and pharmaceutical industries,” said Issam Mudawar, Purdue University’s Betty Ruth and Milton B. Hollander Family Professor of Mechanical Engineering. “We have developed over a hundred years’ worth of understanding of how these systems work in Earth’s gravity, but we haven’t known how they work in weightlessness.”
A team of engineers at Purdue led by Mudawar, who is collaborating with NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, has spent 11 years developing a facility to investigate these phenomena.
The facility is called the Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE). Initial designs were tested on Zero Gravity Corporation’s (Zero-G) weightless research lab, a specially modified Boeing 727 that flies parabolic maneuvers to create the reduced gravities on the moon and Mars as well as the weightless conditions in space.
Following in-flight testing, NASA Glenn and the agency’s Biological and Physical Sciences Division assisted Mudawar’s team in creating a smaller version of the experiment to fit into the Fluids Integrated Rack on the International Space Station. After passing NASA safety and readiness reviews, FBCE launched to the space station in August 2021 and has since helped researchers to begin to unlock the mystery of how boiling and condensation work in the extreme environments of space.
These answers are in data the team is collecting from two sets of FBCE experiments taking place on the station. Last July, the facility’s first experiment finished gathering all the data that Mudawar says scientists need to understand how reduced gravity affects boiling. In the coming months, the equipment for the second experiment will launch to the orbiting laboratory as part of a Northrop Grumman commercial resupply services mission for NASA (NG-19) to gather data on how condensation happens in a reduced gravity environment.
Both experiments making up the facility will remain in orbit through 2025, allowing the fluid physics community at large to take advantage of this data.
“We are ready to literally close the book on the whole science of flow and boiling in reduced gravity,” Mudawar said. “Astronauts on the moon will need air conditioning systems, refrigeration systems and many other systems that all require boiling and condensation. Because of the new understanding we’ve received from data showing how these phenomena are influenced by reduced gravity, we are able to provide guidance into how to size the equipment, how to design it effectively and how to predict its performance.”
The researchers are preparing a series of research papers unpacking data the FBCE has collected on the International Space Station, adding to more than 60 papers they have published on weightlessness and fluid flow since testing their facility on Zero-G flights at the beginning of the project.
“The papers we have published over the duration of this project are really almost like a textbook for how to use boiling and condensation in space,” Mudawar said. “For more than 60 years, since the beginning of spaceflight, the field has known that boiling and condensation would be ideal for space, but previous attempts to study these concepts in microgravity hadn’t been successful.”
Each decade the National Academies publishes a report that guides NASA, the White House and Congress on areas of research to prioritize for funding over the next 10 years. In the 2011 report, numerous scientists recommended that the role of gravity in controlling vapor-fluid behavior be considered as one of those priorities for space exploration. The FBCE project was created in response to the decadal report.
The farther missions are from Earth, the more likely that the spacecraft for those missions will need nuclear power. Compared to other types of processes that enable heating and cooling in space, boiling and condensation are much more effective at transferring heat for these nuclear-powered vehicles and habitats. Boiling and condensation would also allow heat, ventilation and air conditioning systems to be more compact and lightweight.
Since the 1970s, Mudawar has been working to make it possible to use boiling and condensation to tackle energy transfer and temperature control challenges for a wide range of systems. Examples include high-temperature turbine systems, supercomputers, data centers, avionics, hybrid vehicle power electronics, hydrogen fuel cells, metal alloy heat treating, particle accelerators and fusion reactors.
According to Mudawar, FBCE is the first set of experiments to provide data that is extensive and systematic enough for developing the models engineers need to design all sorts of space systems using boiling and condensation in reduced gravity.
“We now have a basis for comparing and contrasting data for both Earth gravity and reduced gravity in pursuit of modeling tools that can be applicable to a broad range of gravities,” Mudawar said.
Mudawar and his students have been developing three sets of predictive tools over the past 11 years based on FBCE data. One set of tools puts the data into the form of equations that engineers can use to design space systems. Another set identifies fundamental information about fluid physics from the data, and the third set is computational models of the fluid dynamics.
All together, these models would make it possible to predict which equipment designs could operate in lunar and Martian gravity.
FBCE is NASA’s largest and most complex experiment for fluid physics research. Between February and July last year, the facility successfully conducted 234 tests, yielding nearly 3,800 data points and an equal number of high-speed video records.
More than 35 engineers and technicians from different teams across NASA Glenn have worked on this project, helping turn design concepts from Mudawar and his students into a facility that could be installed into the space station. These teams included Glenn’s FBCE Engineering, Safety and Mission Assurance, Science, Software, and Technician teams, and Fluids and Combustion Facility Operations teams.
Fifteen past and current Purdue PhD students have assisted Mudawar on all aspects of collaborative work with NASA. Two Purdue doctoral candidates, V.S. Devahdhanush and Steven Darges, assisted in monitoring the experiments on the space station via a dedicated workstation set up at Purdue. The Purdue team also provided recommendations for refinement of operating conditions for subsequent tests to continuously improve science yield per test.
Data from the FBCE would benefit not only space systems, but also technology on Earth. Using lessons they learned about boiling from this data, Mudawar and his team invented a new charging cable design for electric vehicles that would allow them to charge in less than five minutes. Today’s most advanced charging cables take more than 20 minutes to charge an electric vehicle. A patent application for this fast-charging cable invention has been filed through the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization.
“The amount of data coming out of the FBCE is just absolutely enormous, and that’s exactly what we want,” Mudawar said.

Digital revolution inspires new research direction in ecosystem structural diversity,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A special issue of the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment lays the foundation for pursuing structural diversity as a new research direction in ecology. The issue, funded by the National Science Foundation, also describes the digital data collection methods that enable the new research direction, and the applications of the work in various ecosystems.
“Structural diversity is thinking about what elements occupy a space and how they have been arranged in the space,” said the special issue’s lead editor, Songlin Fei, a professor of forestry and natural resources and the Dean’s Chair of Remote Sensing at Purdue. “The hope is that we’re providing a framework that can be applied regardless of the system that you’re working in, from terrestrial to aquatic.”
As Fei and three co-editors wrote in their overview, the special issue’s contributions “provide a new framework for structural diversity, new applications to ecological theory, and case studies.”
The co-editors were Purdue’s Brady Hardiman, associate professor of urban ecology in Purdue’s Department of Forestry and Natural Resources; Elizabeth LaRue, assistant professor of biological sciences at the University of Texas at El Paso; and Kyla Dahlin, associate professor of geography, environment and spatial sciences at Michigan State University.
Six of the seven lead authors in the special issue are early-career scientists who are developing applications for the 3D technologies that could result in new ecological theories. These technologies include light detection and ranging (lidar), and data sensors mounted on drones and satellites.
“Adopting these emerging digital tools and technologies will enable the next generation of ecologists to gracefully operate a fleet of sensors to measure ecosystems and swim freely in the resulting ocean of data,” the editors wrote.
Such methods form the basis of Purdue’s new Center for Digital Forestry, which Fei directs. As one of the five strategic investments in Purdue’s Next Moves, the center leverages digital technology and multidisciplinary expertise to measure, monitor and manage urban and rural forests to maximize social, economic and ecological benefits.
“In the past, as scientists we measured the Earth as a flat entity,” said LaRue, a former postdoctoral researcher mentored by Fei and Hardiman. “That’s in part because we didn’t have good technology to measure 3D aspects of the planet.”
Those aspects include elevation differences and fine-scale features such as the branching patterns of trees. Previously, researchers had to make such measurements by hand.
“The technology is rapidly advancing. We need to catch up on the science and the theory that are being enabled by these 3D technologies,” she said.
The special issue notes that despite key work already started in forestry, more needs to be done in ecosystem types like wetlands, grasslands and marine ecosystems.
“Our knowledge is still quite limited about structural diversity in different ecosystem types,” LaRue said.
Traditionally, scientists have sought to measure biodiversity by counting species and assessing their genetic diversity.
“These existing measures come back to this basic question: How much of the available ecological space has been occupied by different organisms?” Hardiman said. “The more ecological space that has been occupied by different species, the more stable the system might be, because missing one species would not cause the collapse of the system.”
But with the new 3D digital technologies, researchers can now quickly determine the layered arrangement of species within an environment, along with their size and number. Such capabilities benefit land managers as well as researchers. Managers now can often collect higher-quality data much faster and at less expense to help their decision-making. Sometimes they can simply use a cellphone app to make measurements that previously required a tape measure.
The editors and authors of the special issue highlight four challenges that researchers need to address to realize the full potential of such digital advances in ecology.
The first challenge is for ecologists and environmental scientists to collaborate more extensively with colleagues in other specialties. The needed expertise ranges from aviation technology, engineering and computer science to graphic design, information science and the social sciences.
The second challenge is to apply supercomputers, cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to process the massive 3D data sets that digital technology now generates.
“A lot of the data we work with is publicly accessible and available,” Fei said. But researchers sometimes lack the expertise to take advantage of it. “They don’t have the computational capacity or the right tools to handle it,” he said.
The third challenge is to adopt new approaches to better assess the hundreds of variables in ecosystem structure that 3D data sets now often present. Instead of depending on traditional hypothesis testing, the editorial team recommended that researchers should take data-driven approaches or combine the two.
And finally, the editors emphasized the critical importance of training the next generation of ecologists in digital technology.
“New data-oriented skills such as acquisition, visualization, analysis, and management of large datasets must become essential parts of ecological training,” they wrote.",[{'summary_text': 'a special issue of the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment lays the foundation for pursuing structural diversity as a new research direction . six of the seven lead authors in the special issue are early-career scientists who are developing applications for the 3D technologies . the editors emphasize the critical importance of training the next generation of ecologists in digital technology .'}]
Purdue’s popular aseptic processing and packaging workshop now offered online,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Modern grocery store shelves are filled with shelf-stable packaged foods. Everything from vegetables to dairy and meat products can be prepackaged and stored without the need for refrigeration, making them more accessible to consumers everywhere.
The process through which food and pharmaceutical products become shelf-stable starts with aseptic processing and packaging – a sterilization technique that Purdue University has been a leader in since the late 1960s.
One of Purdue’s contributions to the field is the Aseptic Processing and Packaging Workshop, a hands-on course that gives students a thorough introduction to the scientific and engineering principles behind aseptic processing and packaging. In 2022, Purdue held its 39th annual Aseptic Workshop, which is open to the general public.
In response to the continued popularity of the workshop, Purdue is now offering it in a fully online format. The online course will cover all the same topics as the in-person workshop, but students will complete their work virtually on a more flexible schedule.
“Each year, there are more participants who want to attend the course but cannot get enrolled due to the capacity for the in-person workshop, which is limited to 72 seats,” said Dharmendra Mishra, associate professor of food science at Purdue. “The online option will help extend the learnings to a wider aseptic community, especially for those whose schedules do not allow the dedicated time for an in-person workshop and for international participants.”
Topics presented in the online workshop include an overview of aseptic processing and packaging; microbial principles applied to aseptic processing; chemical considerations; principles of thermal processing and thermo-bacteriology; equipment features; packaging and assessment of the package’s sealing integrity; and compliance considerations. Upon request, the workshop’s content can be customized to fit the individual needs of companies. This makes the online workshop a readily accessible upskilling tool for employees working in the aseptic packaging industry.
“Training of personnel is a key factor in keeping the food safe in commercial food manufacturing,” Mishra said. “It helps employees learn the fundamentals of manufacturing operations and steps that are taken to avoid potential risk to the food product. We collaborate with various corporate partners for their specific needs for empowering employees.”
The online course has open registration, and participants can start at any time. The workshop is worth 2.4 Continuing Education Units and 24 contact hours. It is open to all kinds of professionals from a variety of industries and taught by an aseptic processing expert.

"Anu, previously gropod, awarded nearly $1 million competitive grant from the National Science Foundation","summarize:EVANSVILLE, Ind. —
Heliponix LLC, doing business as anu™ (previously gropod®), has been awarded a Phase II National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant for $970,993 and $75,000 in matching funding from Elevate Ventures.
Anu will continue its research and development work on multispectral photomorphogenesis that is now being deployed in conjunction with deep-learning, computer-vision algorithms within its novel rotary aeroponic cultivation chambers. It was previously awarded an NSF SBIR Phase I grant of $256,000, in addition to $50,000 in matching funding from Elevate Ventures. An online video shows the technology in use.
Anu was established six years ago by two undergraduate students in the Purdue Polytechnic Institute who were working on a NASA-funded research study at Purdue University. The research sought to optimize the photosynthetic efficiency of growing lettuce in a controlled-environment hydroponic chamber for astronauts to grow crops more efficiently in space. By manipulating the spectrum of LED light on the lettuce plants, the research team, led by Cary Mitchell, a professor of horticulture in the College of Agriculture, saw an increase in yields while simultaneously reducing the system’s energy consumption.
Research team members Scott Massey and Ivan Ball, co-founders of anu, saw an opportunity to further increase yields and minimize energy consumption. Their innovative design, called the Rotary Aeroponic™ Cultivation Chamber, which has multiple patents pending, produces higher yields through its novel mechanical design coupled with a novel control algorithm facilitated through proprietary cloud software.
“Through decentralized, in-home production of produce, the wasteful inefficiencies and environmental destruction attributed to industrialized agriculture are eliminated, while simultaneously delivering maximum freshness, flavor and nutritional value directly to consumers conveniently,” said anu CEO Massey. “Produce is harvested when consumers are hungry rather than everything being harvested at the same time, which requires preservation of the produce. It simply stays alive and fresh until it’s eaten. The anu team is now composed of more than 20 team members and continues to rapidly grow.”
Massey said the Phase I SBIR grant from the NSF supported anu’s “light recipe” research to maximize plant growth yields, nutritional content and energy efficiency within the proprietary Rotary Aeroponic Cultivation Chambers.
“We are now deploying those discoveries into our Phase II deep-learning, computer-vision system to commercialize an autonomous cultivation system for consumers to sustainably eliminate their dependency on grocery stores for eligible produce varieties without preexisting horticultural knowledge required,” Massey said. “Our ‘Keurig for plants’ commercialization strategy empowers consumers to grow their own Pure Produce® that is more food safe, free of any pesticides and/or preservatives, and has much less environmental impact than industrial agriculture. This accomplishment is a giant leap forward as this century’s Victory Gardens will unite to become the world’s largest farm without owning a single acre of land.”
As a leader in tunable horticultural research lighting systems, the Lighting Enabled Systems and Applications (LESA) Center of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has and continues to work with Anu to provide research-grade, multispectral, tunable LED modules and associated programmable control systems compatible with Heliponix’s rotary chamber. These modules are based on the LESA Center’s TIGER horticulture research lighting modules and will provide the research flexibility needed in Phase II to optimize the LED illumination impact on plant growth variables in leafy greens including biomass, crop yield, nutritional content and energy efficiency.
“NSF is proud to support the technology of the future by thinking beyond incremental developments and funding the most creative, impactful ideas across all markets and areas of science and engineering,” said Andrea Belz, division director of the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships at NSF. “With the support of our research funds, any deep technology startup or small business can guide basic science into meaningful solutions that address tremendous needs.”
Once a small business is awarded a Phase II SBIR/STTR grant, up to $1 million, it becomes eligible to receive up to $500,000 in additional matching funds with qualifying third-party investment or sales.
Startups or entrepreneurs who submit a three-page Project Pitch will know within three weeks if they meet the program’s objectives to support innovative technologies that show promise of commercial and/or societal impact and involve a level of technical risk.

VR avatars rival online interactions in creating closeness,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Can virtual reality (VR) avatars foster meaningful human connections as effectively as that of other online communication methods, and even real-life interactions? A Purdue University case study suggests they can. The study also demonstrates the potential for VR avatar use to reduce race and gender bias.
“We hypothesized that outcomes wouldn’t differ regardless of whether the interacting avatars appeared to be human or not and regardless of whether there was a match or a mismatch in avatar type between interactants,” said Chris Agnew, the study’s author and a professor of psychological sciences in Purdue’s College of Health and Human Sciences. “Our results showed that closeness and related outcomes can be generated and experienced in virtual reality regardless of the stylized avatar types we used in the study.”
Agnew also suggests that if non-human VR avatars allow people to meaningfully connect, they may have untapped potential for mitigating bias by eliminating gender, race and ethnicity cues from interactions.

Researchers tailor thickness of conducting nitrides and oxides to enhance their photonic applications,"summarize:Purdue University researchers found that by tailoring the film thickness of conducting nitrides and oxides, specifically plasmonic titanium nitride (TiN) and aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), they can control the materials’ optical properties, most notably their epsilon near zero (ENZ) behaviors. The TiN and AZO materials developed at Purdue also feature the lowest reported optical losses. This provides novel applications for the telecommunications field and furthers the study of many optical nonlinearities.
Vladimir M. Shalaev and Alexandra Boltasseva, Purdue professors of electrical and computer engineering, and their team of researchers, led by then-postdoctoral researcher Soham Saha, investigated this method of controlling the ENZ point, the wavelength at which a material is neither dielectric nor metallic. When light travels through an ENZ material, its group velocity slows to near zero, and it’s able to interact with the material for a longer period. This gives rise to many interesting nonlinearities. However, with most conventional materials, the ENZ point is fixed and difficult to move.
What the researchers demonstrated is that the thickness association of the optical properties is one of the easiest things to manipulate, enabling them to grow films with different ENZ properties using the same growth environment. By tailoring the thickness of material films and controlling light absorption near the ENZ regime, researchers can study absolute ENZ physics at many different wavelength ranges. The enables a wide range of nonlinear optical phenomena, including all-optical switching, time refraction and high-harmonic generation.
Shalaev, the Bob and Anne Burnett Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, has been a pioneer in the fields of transformation optics, metamaterials, nanophotonics and plasmonics since 1990. He is the scientific director of nanophotonics at Purdue’s Birck Nanotechnology Center.
Boltasseva is the Ron and Dotty Garvin Tonjes Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue. She pioneered the field of alternative plasmonic materials and the application of conducting oxides, nitrides and MXenes in photonics.
The study is published in the journal Advanced Materials. An abstract is available online.

Researchers developed a low-loss, polycrystalline films of TiN on silicon by reactive magnetron sputtering. AZO was grown by pulsed laser deposition on the as-grown TiN. They investigated the cause of the thickness-dependent optical properties through spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, connecting the optical properties to their structural properties. As a proof of concept of a dynamic, tunable device, researchers demonstrated all-optical switching of the resonators using an interband pump, showing picosecond relaxation times.

Purdue launches new AI-based global forest mapping project,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University’s Jingjing Liang has received a two-year, $870,000 grant from the World Resources Institute to map global forest carbon accumulation rates.
“To accurately capture the carbon accumulation rates of forested ecosystems across the world has always been a challenging task, mostly because doing so requires lots of ground-sourced data, and currently such data are very limited to the scientific community,” said Liang, an associate professor of quantitative forest ecology and co-director of the Forest Advanced Computing and Artificial Intelligence Lab.
“This task is considerably more challenging than mapping carbon emissions from forest loss,” said Nancy Harris, research director of the Land & Carbon Lab at the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, D.C. “With emissions, there’s a clear signal in satellite imagery when trees are cut, leading to a big drop in forest carbon stocks and a relatively abrupt pulse of emissions to the atmosphere. With sequestration, forests accumulate carbon gradually and nonlinearly.
“Even the most advanced satellite sensor can’t capture this reliably on its own, especially in older forests where the signal saturates. A forest stops getting taller long before it stops accumulating carbon.”
Forest carbon accumulation rates are sensitive to the subtle changes in three forest growth components: ingrowth, upgrowth and mortality. Ingrowth represents the number of small seedlings that have attained a specific threshold size to be called trees. Upgrowth is the gradual increase in diameter of trees through the process of photosynthesis. Ground-sourced forest inventory data measured at multiple points in time is currently the only reliable source of information for accurate quantification of these three forest growth components.
“To date, people have never been able to estimate the ingrowth, upgrowth and mortality rates of individual forest stands at a global scale. This information gap leaves huge uncertainty in the size, location and trend of global forest carbon sink,” Liang said.
Liang is developing an artificial intelligence model that will combine information collected about billions of trees measured on-site with satellite and other geospatial data to map local forest growth rates throughout the global forest range.
“This will be the first AI-based forest growth model deployed at a global scale,” he said. Beyond accurately quantifying carbon dynamics, Liang’s AI-based forest growth model will also capture the dynamics of forest biodiversity and timber quality.
“We’re excited to support the growth of this research collaboration,” Harris said. “The spatially granular data this new project will provide will help us better understand the role our planet’s forests play in local, nature-based solutions to mitigate global climate change. The inclusive and globally networked approach of this initiative is at the heart of the mission of WRI’s Land & Carbon Lab.”
Developing such a model requires massive computing power and comprehensive global data coverage. The state-of-the-art high-performance computing clusters at Purdue will provide sufficient computing support. Still, achieving comprehensive global coverage of ground-sourced plot data remains a challenge, particularly in tropical countries.
“The data from these countries have been limited historically,” Liang said. “Through the newly established network of Science-i and its sister consortium, the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative, we already have working relationships with a large number of scientists across the world who are collecting and sharing those data.”
Liang founded Science-i, a web-based collaboration platform involving more than 300 scientists around the world. He also co-founded the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative, which has built a database of 1.3 million sample plots and 55 million trees. That database will serve as the project’s basis.
“We are going to collect much more data, especially from the global south, to fill those data gaps,” Liang said. “We will get more people involved, especially those from underrepresented groups.”
Collaborators of this project already include representatives of Indigenous groups across North America, Amazonia, Africa and elsewhere. Rural communities, forestry practitioners and citizen scientists will also become project collaborators.
“We co-produce the knowledge based on the FAIR principle of global collaboration: findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable,” Liang said.
“In Science-i, everyone collaborates with each other as equal partners on all projects. We openly share our findings with transparent real-time discussions across the whole team. Then we cross-evaluate and consolidate our research findings at the end. This is a brand-new way to do international collaborative forest research.”
The extensive global partnership and comprehensive forest tree database created from this project will complement Purdue’s Digital Forestry Initiative, which seeks to leverage technology and multidisciplinary expertise to measure, monitor and manage urban and rural forests.
Liang is co-lead, with Ximena Bernal, associate professor of biological sciences, for the Biodiversity Research Community, part of Purdue’s recently launched multidisciplinary Institute for a Sustainable Future.

Study: How to apply lessons from Colorado’s costliest wildfire to drinking water systems,"summarize:Wildfire damage to drinking water systems can significantly delay a community’s economic recovery. The costliest disaster in Colorado’s history, the Marshall Fire of 2021, resulted in more than $2 billion in losses. Six drinking water systems were directly in the fire’s path.
While communities and governments nationwide have been facing the impact of these disasters on drinking water systems, no national synthesis of scientific and policy needs has been conducted. Now, a study has outlined the scientific and policy needs specific to drinking water systems’ resilience to wildfires.
At the request of two Colorado cities shortly following the Marshall Fire, Purdue University researchers provided onsite technical assistance and led the case study. The goal was to better understand the decisions, resources, expertise and response limitations during and after the wildfire. The team also included collaborators from the University of Colorado Boulder, Oregon State University and Corona Environmental Consulting LLC.
The researchers say that should the needs identified by this study be addressed, drinking water safety risks could be minimized, and wildfire-vulnerable communities could better protect their workers and the overall population and expedite recovery.
Andrew Whelton is a professor of civil engineering and environmental and ecological engineering. He also directs the Healthy Plumbing Consortium and Center for Plumbing Safety. His research group specializes in disaster response and recovery when critical infrastructure systems are impacted.
The study is published in AWWA Water Science. Full access to the paper is available on the journal’s website.

City of Louisville, Colorado
Purdue researchers were called for help and teamed with multiple organizations that were impacted by, and responded to, the Marshall Fire. To conduct this case study, the team met with utility staff, visited the areas impacted, inspected damaged systems and customer properties, and assisted with developing drinking water infrastructure damage and contamination assessment strategies. Insights from the Boulder County Health Department, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regions 8 and 9 and community members were also reviewed. The team reviewed water sampling and testing records, public announcements and meeting recordings.

Transistors repurposed as microchip ‘clock’ address supply chain weakness,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Microchip fab plants in the United States can cram billions of data processing transistors onto a tiny silicon chip, but a critical device, in essence a “clock,” to time the operation of those transistors must be made separately – creating a weak point in chip security and the supply line. A new approach uses commercial chip fab materials and techniques to fabricate specialized transistors that serve as the building block of this timing device, addressing the weak point and enabling new functionality through enhanced integration.
“You would have one chip that does everything instead of multiple chips, multiple fabrication methods and multiple material sets that must be integrated – often overseas,” said Dana Weinstein, a Purdue University professor of electrical and computer engineering, who is developing acoustic resonators with the processes used to produce industry-standard fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs). “There’s a need for America to advance its capabilities in chip manufacturing, and an advance of this nature addresses multiple concerns in supply chain, national security and hardware security. By moving the whole clock inside the processor, you harden the device against clock-glitching attacks, and you enable new functionality such as acoustic fingerprinting of the packaged chip for tamper detection.”
Like all transistors – the devices that undergird modern microelectronics – FinFETs are a voltage-activated on/off gate. As its name suggests, a FinFET passes a current along a fin of semiconducting material that runs through the gate. In the closed, or off, state, the fin does not conduct electricity. A voltage applied to the top of the gate builds an electric charge in the fin, allowing electricity to flow in an open, or on, state.
But transistors must be synchronized to perform operations for microprocessors, sensors and radios used in all electronic devices. The devices that do this are built on sound, the resonant frequency that some structures emit, much as a glass bowl may sound a specific note when pinged. The regular repeating wave of this so-called acoustic resonator serves as a cadence that is incorporated into a larger microelectromechanical system and used to mark time. Current commercial microelectromechanical resonators cannot be fabricated in a standard chip fabrication process and must be made separately and later bundled with microchips for use.
Weinstein’s innovation is to build an acoustic resonator with the existing repertoire of materials and fabrication techniques available in a standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor chip fab. In a recent paper in Nature Electronics, her research team reports its most advanced design to date. Using a commercial process run at the GlobalFoundries Fab 8 facility in New York and described in the GlobalFoundries 14LPP FinFET technology design manual, team members fabricated a specialized set of FinFETs capable of producing a frequency in the range of 8-12 gigahertz, which exceeds the typical native clock rates of microprocessors.
The elegant solution essentially repurposes data processing transistors into a timing device.
“With our approach, the chip fab runs this device through the same process they would use for a computer’s central processing unit or other application,” said Jackson Anderson, a Purdue graduate student in electrical and computer engineering and first author on the Nature Electronics paper. “When the microprocessor and other components are done, so is the resonator. It doesn’t have to undergo further fabrication or be sent somewhere else for integration with a separate microprocessor chip.”
Although the on or off state of a transistor ordinarily directs current to serve as the 0s and 1s of binary code, all transistors can also be used as capacitors to store and release a charge. Weinstein’s team does exactly that with arrays of “drive” transistors, squeezing and releasing a thin layer of dielectric materials between the fin and the gate.
“We’re squeezing those layers between the gate and the semiconductor, pushing and pulling on that thin region between the gate and the fin,” Jackson said. “We do this alternately on adjacent transistors – one compressing, one stretching – building vibrations laterally in the device.”
The drive transistors are sized to guide and amplify the vibrations into building upon themselves into a specific resonant frequency. This, in turn, stretches and compresses the semiconductor material in an adjacent group of “sense” transistors, which alters the characteristics of a current across those transistors, translating the vibration into an electrical signal.
“Every single piece of high-performance electronics that you have uses FinFETs,” Weinstein said. “Integrating these functions advances our microelectronics capabilities beyond just digital microprocessors. If the technology changes, we can adapt, but we would be moving forward with an integrated microprocessor system.”

Purdue’s online engineering graduate programs gain overall in U.S. News rankings of Best Online Programs,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University online engineering increased its overall standing and remained No. 1 in four categories, placing it among the nation’s elite in the newest U.S. News & World Report rankings of the Best Online Programs.
The rankings, released Tuesday (Jan. 24), have the university’s full array of online engineering graduate programs at No. 2, up from No. 3 in 2022, while Purdue remains in the No. 1 spot in four specific categories.
Collectively, online master’s programs from the Purdue College of Engineering rank second among 119 colleges and universities considered for the rankings after placing third in each of the previous three years. Purdue’s online engineering master’s programs as a whole trail only the University of California, Los Angeles. Among Big Ten schools, Purdue heads the list, with Pennsylvania State University ranked third, ahead of four other Big Ten schools in the top 10: the universities of Illinois (fourth), Michigan (sixth), Wisconsin (eighth) and Nebraska (10th).
Purdue online master’s degrees in electrical engineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering and engineering management all rank No. 1 for 2023, as they did in 2022. The online civil engineering master’s is No. 2, also the same as in 2022.
In addition, Purdue‘s ranking in online engineering master’s programs for veterans moved up to No. 4 from No. 5 in 2022. The newest rankings can be viewed online.
“The latest U.S. News rankings reflect our ongoing momentum as we expand the range, scale and impact of Purdue engineering’s online learning,” said Mark Lundstrom, interim dean of Purdue’s College of Engineering and the Don and Carol Scifres Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “Our growing suite of courses, certificates and degrees in microelectronic and semiconductor engineering is one recent example of how our faculty, staff and university and corporate partners are creating online opportunities for students – opportunities that address the nation’s critical need for an expanded and upskilled semiconductor workforce.”
Dimitrios Peroulis, Purdue’s Michael and Katherine Birck Head and Reilly Professor in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said, “Purdue engineering will remain committed to offering quality programs through innovative educational vehicles for our growing online community. We are grateful to our online students, dedicated faculty, academic advisors, success coaches, alumni and Purdue engineering online staff for their critical contributions to this effort.”
Peroulis has served as engineering’s academic lead for online learning since January 2018 and has been appointed senior vice president of Purdue University Online, effective July 1, 2023.
Purdue is engaged in an initiative to build a best-in-class collection of online courses and programs to serve a variety of students, working professionals and corporate partners with high-quality offerings that address high-need, high-demand areas and are accessible, affordable and demonstrably beneficial.
“At a time when education throughout our lives is more important than ever, Purdue’s leaders recognize that online learning needs to have an integral place in the university’s future and that it is, indeed, central to Purdue’s role as a model 21st-century land-grant institution,” said Gary Bertoline, senior vice president for Purdue University Online and Learning Innovation.
The organizers of the annual U.S. News rankings analyze such factors as the quality of students entering a program; online teaching practices so students stay enrolled and graduate on time; how the programs employ technologies to allow students flexibility; and the quality of student support services, career guidance and financial aid resources.
Also weighed are faculty credentials and training, including the degree to which online instructors’ credentials mirror those of on-campus faculty and the training instructors receive to teach distance learners.
In addition, U.S. News conducts a peer assessment survey of high-ranking academic officials – in the case of the engineering rankings, deans of engineering schools and top online learning leaders – as an important element of reviewing Purdue and other institutions for ranking.

How economic policy impacts crime – new video uploaded to AP Video Hub,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
A video featuring Jillian Carr, associate professor of economics in Purdue University’s Krannert School of Management, has been uploaded to the AP Video Hub. In this video, she explains how economic policies affect crime in intended and unintended ways. This video can be found at https://apvideohub.ap.org/detail/Howeconomicpolicyimpactscrime/8b5de7f8c7404970b847f1c26edc7fd2/video?hpSectionId=2293806a10614a0e876a24f1bb66e24a&st=hpsection&mediaType=video&sortBy=arrivaldatetime:desc&dateRange=Anytime&totalCount=32&currentItemNo=0. All videos in the Campus Insights series are free for download and use by all AP members and can be found at apvideohub.ap.org or by doing a general search on the Associated Press site. AP members may use the video or pull quotes for print articles, broadcasts or podcasts.
Jillian Carr is an associate professor of economics at Purdue University. In this video, she explains how economic policies affect crime in intended and unintended ways. Carr says that economic policy primarily impacts crime because it impacts people’s resources. When people lack resources, they are more likely to commit crimes. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has a primary goal of feeding people. By giving people this resource, the program has an additional unintended consequence of reducing crime. Economists need to think of all the likely outcomes when implementing a policy to make sure that it accomplishes its goal without having unintended negative consequences. For example, Carr studied a juvenile curfew implemented in Washington, D.C., that was meant to reduce gun violence. However, more gunshots were reported after the curfew was implemented because it was easier to commit crime when fewer people were around.","[{'summary_text': 'a video featuring economist Jillian Carr has been uploaded to the AP Video Hub . in this video, she explains how economic policies affect crime in intended and unintended ways .'}]"

"David MacMillan, the 2021 Nobel laureate in chemistry, to join President Chiang for Presidential Lecture Series on Feb. 13","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Renowned Princeton University professor and entrepreneur David W.C. MacMillan, who shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking work on catalysis, will join Purdue University President Mung Chiang for a conversation at the first Presidential Lecture Series event of 2023 on Feb. 13.
The discussion with MacMillan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry at Princeton, is at 6 p.m. Feb. 13 in Stewart Center’s Fowler Hall. The event, which is free and open to the public, is titled “The Path to Invention and Discovery in Catalysis.” It also is the first Presidential Lecture Series event hosted by Chiang, whose administration plans to continue the lecture series launched in 2014 by his predecessor, Purdue President Emeritus Mitch Daniels.
“To continue enhancing the vibrancy of intellectual life on campus and to celebrate the scholarly impact of our colleagues, we are organizing various events with broad participation,” Chiang said. “The Presidential Lecture Series will continue, and I would like to warmly welcome my former colleague David MacMillan, a groundbreaking scholar at the pinnacle of excellence in research and in entrepreneurial impact, to Purdue and West Lafayette.”
The Scottish-born MacMillan shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with organic chemist Benjamin List from Germany. MacMillan and List had developed a type of catalysis in 2000 that built on small organic molecules. Using a process called asymmetric organocatalysis, their toolkit now makes it easier to produce asymmetric molecules — chemicals that exist in two versions where, like our human hands, one is a mirror image of the other.
Catalysts are substances that accelerate chemical reactions without becoming part of the final product, an especially important factor for chemists in their efforts to construct molecules. When they are being built, two different molecules actually can form as mirrored images. Chemists often want only one of these mirror images, particularly when producing medicines, but it has been difficult to find efficient methods to do this.
The pioneering process that MacMillan and List developed is helping solve this scientific challenge, paving the way for discovering new drugs and even making molecules that can capture light in solar cells. Chemistry also is made more environmentally friendly because of their innovation.
“Building molecules is a difficult art. Benjamin List and David MacMillan are awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2021 for their development of a precise new tool for molecular construction: organocatalysis. This has had a great impact on pharmaceutical research, and has made chemistry greener,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted in announcing the award.
For his Purdue discussion, MacMillan will highlight the advent and development of asymmetric organocatalysis in his laboratory. As an overview, he will explore concepts of chemical reactivity, catalysis and the asymmetry of organic molecules. He also will examine the impact of organocatalysis on modern synthetic chemistry and explore the real-world applications of the technology.
“We will discuss the ways in which organocatalysis created a bridge to the development of a new field of research in our lab: visible light photoredox catalysis,” MacMillan said in the abstract explaining his talk of the field of photochemistry that uses single-electron transfer. “Last, we will look to the future and consider how organocatalysis may continue to impact scientific research and society.”
After his Nobel win, MacMillan used his share of the $1.14 million prize to establish the May and Billy MacMillan Foundation. Created to honor his parents, the foundation supports educational opportunities for financially disadvantaged students in Scotland. MacMillan also contributed any money for talks he gave during 2022 to the foundation.
While at Harvard University in the late 1990s, MacMillan had been working with metal catalysts. But the types used in his research were rarely embraced by industry. The problem: While the oxygen-free and moisture-free conditions demanded by some metal catalysts were possible to achieve in the lab, this was much more difficult at large scales.
MacMillan studied chemistry as an undergraduate at the University of Glasgow. He then came to the United States in 1990, where he pursued his doctoral studies at the University of California, Irvine. Having earned a PhD, he took a postdoctoral position at Harvard University in 1996. There, MacMillan’s began his research focus on catalysis.
In 1998, MacMillan was appointed to the chemistry faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, before moving on to Princeton in 2006 as the A. Barton Hepburn Professor of Chemistry, where he is currently the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry. He also served as department chair at Princeton from 2010-15.

Longtime Purdue benefactor Bruce White dies at 70,"summarize:Purdue University, along with White Lodging, is mourning the passing of Bruce White on Jan. 19, 2023. White, 70, was founder and chairman of White Lodging, a former member of the Purdue Board of Trustees, a Purdue alumnus and longtime benefactor of the university.
White was universally regarded as a leader in entrepreneurial ventures in the world of hospitality, and the company he developed is respected across the industry for its long-term focus and reputation for quality and results – in development, ownership and management of premium, urban and lifestyle hotels and restaurants.
“In all its history, Indiana has produced few citizens the equal of Bruce White,” said Mitch Daniels, Purdue University president emeritus and former governor of the state of Indiana. “In a spectacular business career, his imagination and boldness created opportunities and wealth for thousands of others. He invested enormously of his energy and personal resources in trying to build the prosperity and quality of life of his beloved Northwest Indiana. And, of course, as trustee, donor and advocate, he was a central figure in building the Purdue University of today. We cannot replace him; we will remember him with the deepest gratitude always.”
White, who served as a Purdue trustee from 2011-15, was a highly respected leader and advocate of numerous hospitality, business and civic organizations. Perhaps none benefited more than his alma mater.
Among the impacts White and the White Family Foundations have made on Purdue:
The Foundation’s visionary establishment of the Dean V. White Real Estate Finance Program with a gift of $20.8 million in 2022 launched an exciting era of undergraduate transformation within the School of Management, making Purdue a top destination for educating future real estate finance professionals. This gift jump-started the university’s vision for a reimagined School of Business, making a campaign initiative possible.
A $5 million commitment to the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management in 2021 is attracting top talent to the West Lafayette campus. Thanks to the named headship, Purdue was able to recruit Ceridwyn King as HTM head. The White Scholars program will help draw more high-caliber students to pursue the finance concentration and go on to have a successful career in hospitality finance. In recognition of this gift, the school was renamed the White Lodging-J.W. Marriott, Jr. School of Hospitality and Tourism Management.
Collective gifts of $30 million for the Union Club Hotel in 2018 have brought to life a hospitable haven for campus visitors while ensuring Purdue’s hospitality and tourism management students participate in hands-on learning experiences.
A gift of $5 million in 2009 to establish the White Lodging School of Hospitality and Tourism Management at Purdue Northwest has established the school as a premier destination for students looking to begin a flourishing hospitality career.
“Purdue Trustees consider it such a privilege to have known and worked alongside Bruce White, who shared with our university the business skills he developed during his wildly successful career,” board chair Michael Berghoff said. “He inspired us with his commitment to considering strategic value in all that we do, a relentless dedication to operational excellence and a very healthy blend of urgency and impatience. He valued his people above everything and invested deeply in creating new opportunities for them to lead and succeed. Bruce made Purdue, our state and our country a better place.”
Purdue President Mung Chiang also offered his gratitude: “Bruce White will always be remembered as one of the greatest Boilermakers and finest citizens of our state. His impact is felt through the many lives he has touched at Purdue and far beyond our campuses. We are ever grateful to have known him and to have benefited from his long-standing dedication and inspiring leadership.”
White Lodging started with a single hotel in 1985 in Merrillville, Indiana, and through Bruce White’s visionary leadership has grown into one of the country’s largest privately held hospitality companies focused exclusively on highly curated urban and lifestyle properties. The company develops, owns and manages a portfolio of brands in destination-driven markets, including Austin, Texas; Chicago; Denver; Nashville, Tennessee; Indianapolis; and Louisville, Kentucky. With a focus on elevated and experiential service, White Lodging’s portfolio consists of more than 50 premium hotels; a private collection of world-renowned luxury ranches; 40 locally relevant, award-winning restaurants; and 10 market-leading rooftop bars.
“Bruce was a visionary, a leader, a hospitality icon like no other,” said White Lodging Chief Executive Officer Jean-Luc Barone. “I have learned more from Bruce about hard work, leadership and family than any other person in my life. And while he maintained a low public profile and was humble in his impact on the industry, there’s no question that Bruce White helped transform the modern hospitality industry by having a long-term vision, challenging existing norms and executing at the highest levels – all from a small town in Northwest Indiana.”
White graduated from Purdue in 1975 with a degree in management, completed the Harvard Graduate School of Business Owner/President Management program and was presented an Honorary Doctor of Business Administration in Hospitality Management by Johnson and Wales University. He was a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Purdue University School of Hospitality and Tourism Management Hall of Fame and a member of the Boiler Business Exchange Business Hall of Fame.
In addition, White was recognized with the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association Lifetime Achievement Award, the Hunter Hotel Developer Award for Excellence & Inspiration and, along with his family, the Will Koch Indiana Tourism Leadership award.
White’s board involvement included University of Chicago Hospitals, the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, the Chicago Economic Club, Big Shoulders Fund, the Terlato Wine Group and Young President’s Organization.
White is survived by his wife, Beth; three children: Corinne, Conner and Patrick; and grandchild Timothy James. Beth and all three children are involved in the hospitality business in various capacities and sit on White Lodging’s Board of Advisors.
Services are pending.","[{'summary_text': 'white, 70, was founder and chairman of white Lodging, a former member of the Purdue Board of Trustees . he was a highly respected leader and advocate of numerous hospitality, business and civic organizations . white graduated from the university in 1975 with a degree in management .'}]"

Using cancer cells as logic gates to determine what makes them move,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Cancer cells migrate through the body for multiple reasons; some are simply following the flow of a fluid, while others are actively following specific chemical trails. So how do you determine which cells are moving and why? Purdue University researchers have reverse-engineered a cellular signal processing system and used it like a logic gate – a simple computer – to better understand what causes specific cells to migrate.

"Purdue engineers improve solar cell efficiency, stability","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University researchers have created new, multifunctional ligands that improve the charge transfer, power conversion capability and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells.
Perovskite is a material that can be formed from different elements to have a variety of electrical, optical and physical characteristics. Perovskite can be manufactured as solar cells with simple techniques similar to printing newspapers; the techniques cost less and use less energy than those used to produce traditional silicon cells. Perovskite solar panels are also much thinner and lighter than silicon panels, making the transportation and installation cost lower. They can be made lightweight and mechanically flexible and portable. But Letian Dou, the Charles Davidson Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering, said perovskite solar cells have traits that limit their effectiveness.
“These solar cells lack an effective charge transfer and are unstable and vulnerable under prolonged light exposure, which often leads to degradation,” Dou said. “Poor stability means a shorter product lifetime, and consumers will need to replace a panel more frequently. Perovskite may not be stable for 25 years like silicon, but at least 10 years is required for successful commercialization. Replacing the panels also adds to the labor cost.”
Dou said traditional solar cells require a critical interface between perovskite and the organic charge collection layer. He said a molecular “glue” is needed, but conventional molecules block the current flow.
“Our conjugated ligands have a perfect fit into the perovskite crystal lattice and can help build a 2D-on-3D perovskite heterostructure, which further enhances the solar panel’s stability,” Dou said.
Dou and his team have tested the innovative ligands in their laboratory.
“We achieved near 25% power conversion efficiency with the ligands, compared to less than 20% without them,” Dou said. “We also improved the lifetime to more than 2,400 hours tested at 65 degrees Celsius, which is four times longer than without the ligands.”
Dou and his team are taking additional steps to improve the ligands.
“We are working on new ligands to further what we’ve already achieved: more than 25% power conversion efficiency and more than 10,000 hours of operational lifetime,” Dou said. “We also are working to apply the ligands in larger-area solar modules. We look to achieve these goals within a year or so.”
Dou disclosed the conjugated ligand innovation to the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for patent protection on the intellectual property. Industry partners interested in further developing the technology for the marketplace should contact Will Buchanan, wdbuchanan@prf.org, about 2021-DOU-69323.
Dou’s research was published in the July 2021 issue of Advanced Materials and the January 2021 issue of Angewandte Chemie. Dou and his team received funding and other support to conduct their research from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office, Purdue’s College of Engineering and the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering.

OmniVis recognized with prestigious Most Fundable Companies designation,"summarize:SAN FRANCISCO and WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
OmniVis, a Purdue University-affiliated biotechnology company focused on the speed, accuracy and economics of pathogen detection, has been named to the fifth annual Most Fundable Companies list from Pepperdine University’s Graziadio Business School.
OmniVis makes iSpyDx hand-held devices that rapidly detect pathogens in food, water and plant samples. The devices perform to laboratory method standards but do not require special equipment or training.
CEO Katherine Clayton, who earned her PhD in mechanical engineering from Purdue, leads the company. Other co-founders are Purdue researchers Tamara Kinzer-Ursem, associate head for academic programs and the Marta E. Gross Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering; Jacqueline Linnes, the Marta E. Gross Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, and director of the College of Engineering Honors Program; and Steven T. Wereley, professor of mechanical engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering.
“The Most Fundable Companies process involved six months of due diligence on OmniVis, providing even further confidence behind everything we are doing at the company,” Clayton said. “By winning the Most Fundable Companies, we were able to extend our network by meeting great entrepreneurs and investors as well as those excited about entrepreneurship. We can’t wait for what comes next.”
Linnes said the technology’s core platform is disease-agnostic and has the ability to detect a variety of DNA and RNA targets.
“When paired with the right sample preparation and primers to amplify nucleic acids, the platform can detect pathogens from food, water and agricultural products, as well as those causing human diseases,” Linnes said. “We have demonstrated the detection of cholera from water samples and malaria, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV from human saliva and blood samples.”
Kinzer-Ursem said the iSpyDx device can be operated without specialized knowledge from the beginning of the detection process to the end.
“We’ve tested the device with a number of domestic and international partners,” Kinzer-Ursem said. “Users with and without technical training are able to use the device.”
Wereley said it is critical to bring university research and innovation to the marketplace. He said there are several options, including launching a company with a recent graduate to run it.
“The benefits of the small company approach are the close relationship between the company and the university researchers, which allows transferral of not just concepts but typically undisclosed know-how from the university to the small company,” Wereley said. “Also, companies have access to different funding streams, including federal SBIR and STTR grants, investors and more that can support research activities at the university.”
OmniVis competed against more than 4,000 early-stage U.S. companies in all 50 states; 16 were recognized. This is the third consecutive year a company with Purdue connections has appeared on the Most Fundable Companies list: Adranos was recognized in 2020, and Amplified Sciences was recognized in 2021.
At OmniVis, we want to put the power of the lab in the palm of your hand. We believe that early detection is key to pathogen elimination. OmniVis started in 2017 and has been growing ever since. Our team focuses on providing user-centered pathogen detection devices to anyone in the world. We are scientists, engineers, educators, epidemiologists and business professionals with diverse backgrounds and a common vision. Developing affordable and accessible pathogen detection platforms to support global health drives our work every day.

Expansive agricultural dataset now available from Purdue University,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
An expansive, multidecadal agricultural dataset is now available from Purdue University. The Southeast Purdue Agricultural Center (SEPAC) drainage research data are from a long-term subsurface drainage project that was conducted at SEPAC in Jennings County, Indiana, from 1984 to 2020. SEPAC is one of eight Purdue Agricultural Centers (PACs) across Indiana that researchers use to conduct applied field crop and animal research. This project was funded in part by the Agricultural Research and Graduate Education (ARGE) office at Purdue and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
“The original goals of the project were to evaluate the effects of different subsurface drain spacings on drain flow and corn growth and yield,” says Eileen Kladivko, professor in the Department of Agronomy and lead-author of the study. “A significant finding was that modern drainage is effective at improving crop growth and yield on these soils that had traditionally not been tile drained; therefore, farmers and landowners in this region have a greater confidence that installing drainage can be a worthwhile investment.”
Additional objectives were added over the years, especially related to movement of agricultural chemicals through the soil into the drainage waters. Now publicly available for use, these data capture changes in drain flow, water quality and crop yield across times of significant change in farm management practices. The main data included are drain flow and nitrate-N concentrations and loads from each of six tile drains, collected on a daily basis, from 1985 through 2015. The agronomic data include crop yields (corn, soybean) and grain moisture content from 1984 through 2020. Weather data were collected on site or at nearby weather stations and are included in the dataset.
“We need long-term studies like these, over a number of years of varying weather patterns, to know the actual impacts of agriculture on water quality and the practices that can improve water quality,” Kladivko says. “Water quality is affected both by human activities and natural weather variations, and decadal studies are important to understand the impacts of both.”
“This is a rare type of dataset, having so many years of data all put together, so it’s really a tribute to Purdue to have had such an experiment and to have such data available for others to use,” says Laura Bowling, professor in the Department of Agronomy and co-author of the study.
The dataset includes four Purdue Extension publications and a list of research publications, along with the data mentioned above. Data may be useful for researchers, agency staff, extension personnel and farmers/landowners testing various models of drainage, water quality and crop yield with time.
“Key findings include the greater loss of nitrate into drainage waters with narrower drain spacings, and the impact of cover crops on reducing nitrate losses to drainage water,” says Kladivko. “We still need more work on technologies to improve our aging drainage systems for both adequate drainage and improved water quality across the vast tile-drained landscapes of Indiana and the Midwest, and without PACs, long-term research like this dataset would not have been possible.”
This research has been an important part of the PAC Field Days, providing educational opportunities for commodity producers, crop/livestock advisors and others seeking knowledge in crop production, farm management, land use and other issues.

Planetary scientist Brandon Johnson’s feet are firmly on the ground, though he uses data from satellites and space missions to study and map planetary bodies in the solar system.
Studying how impacts affect planetary bodies, asteroids, moons and other rocks in space helps planetary scientists understand extraplanetary geology, especially where to look for precious matter including water, ice and even life. A YouTube video is available online.
Past impacts, on Earth and on other planets, can help explain the history of the solar system.
Johnson’s research increases understanding of past and potential asteroid impacts on Earth, for example the huge global tsunami that followed the dinosaur-killing asteroid impact.
Planetary geologist Michelle Thompson studies space weathering, the effect of exposure to space on asteroids and bodies lacking atmospheres, like our own moon.
Thompson studies samples from the original Apollo missions, collected before she was born, to understand the nature of moondust.
The samples brought back by the Hayabusa2 mission, the first asteroid samples ever collected in space and brought back, give insight into conditions on early Earth that may have helped lead to life.
She is on the tiger team for OSIRIS-REx and will be the first woman to study samples from the asteroid Bennu.
Briony Horgan, associate professor of planetary science, led the efforts to designate Jezero Crater for the rover’s landing and now is a long-term planner as part of the science leadership for NASA’s rover. Year 2 research is well underway.

December Consumer Food Insights Report reveals steady food behaviors through economic change,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Data trends that emerged in 2022 help demonstrate that most people are slow to start spending differently when it comes to their favorite foods, despite an economic environment much different than when the year began. But there are some notable exceptions to this stickiness in food behaviors and preferences, according to the newly released Consumer Food Insights Report.
The survey-based report out of Purdue University’s Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability assesses food spending, consumer satisfaction and values, support of agricultural and food policies and trust in information sources.
“Broadly speaking, consumers faced some budget constraints this holiday season,” said Jayson Lusk, the head and Distinguished Professor of Agricultural Economics at Purdue, who leads the center. “About a third said they were worried about being able to afford gifts, but this was far from the majority. When we compare responses to inflation in December to this past summer, most of these behaviors have not increased in frequency.”
Lusk drew attention, however, to the increase in people switching to cheaper brands — unwelcome news for brand names that have worked hard to build a consumer base.
Purdue experts conducted and evaluated the survey, which included 1,200 consumers across the U.S. Additional key results were:
Household food expenditures increased more than 15% from January.
Consumers are shopping at discount stores more and spending less on discretionary expenses.
36% of consumers were worried about being able to afford holiday gifts this year.
14% of consumers are finding certain items out of stock compared to 25% in January.
Sugar was the most common item that consumers limited in their 2022 diets.
“The 15% increase in food spending this year is obviously a significant change and has drawn
much interest in its cause and its effects,” Lusk said. “But it is worth pointing out that our indicators like food security and food satisfaction have not similarly moved in any one direction, which is a good sign that well-being has likely not decreased on average.”
The survey results also show that where people spend these dollars has not shifted. Lusk noted that the popularity of online grocery shopping appears to be declining. This raises questions about the lower limits of online food shopping and whether it was largely buoyed by the COVID pandemic.
As for food behaviors, easing supply chain problems has seemingly meant that consumers have more readily found all the food products they want.
“This year, chicken was the most reported item that people were unable to find at the grocery store,” said Sam Polzin, a food and agriculture survey scientist for the center and co-author of the report. “Given that we are in the middle of the deadliest bird flu outbreak, this is unsurprising.”
People also reported buying fewer sugar and related products.
“Given how bad added sugars are for our health, this is a good change,” Polzin said. “But we also don’t know whether people are actually acting on this reported desire to reduce their sugar intake.”
Polzin drew attention to the December report’s food policy section because debate over the new farm bill will be in full swing this year.
“We observed small increases in the popularity of every surveyed policy, which might indicate that people are open to a range of new food policies given that they are communicated clearly,” Polzin said.
The survey data further show that consumer understanding of potential threats to U.S. agriculture is fairly similar to that of the experts. There is, however, a mismatch regarding possible improvements.
“Improvements from farm diversification are understated by consumers compared to the experts, since consumers believe local and organic food production will deliver similar or greater benefits,” Polzin said.
Further, consumer beliefs that more restrictive standards on the use of genetically modified organisms will improve American well-being is completely out of line with the experts. This mismatch shows how some science has yet to penetrate the general public or is even being skewed to advance misinformed beliefs, he said.
Lusk further discusses the report in his blog. The Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability is part of Purdue’s Next Moves in agriculture and food systems and uses innovative data analysis shared through user-friendly platforms to improve the food system. In addition to the Consumer Food Insights Report, the center offers a portfolio of online dashboards.",[{'summary_text': 'data shows most people are slow to start spending differently when it comes to their favorite foods . but there are notable exceptions to this stickiness in food behaviors and preferences . consumers are shopping at discount stores more and spending less on discretionary expenses .'}]

Purdue announces investments and policies for scholarly impact and research excellence,"summarize:Purdue faculty colleagues,
Welcome back! We are delighted to announce today six new investments or policies to support, incentivize, and reward scholarly impact and research excellence at Purdue. The following updates to enhance faculty productivity and success will become effective immediately:
We will increase staffing in Sponsored Program Services (SPS) by 25%, along with support for necessary tools, to improve faculty services and response times and to address emerging needs and priorities. These changes augment recent increases in pre-award staffing and market adjustments in SPS. Additionally, we will realign SPS to report to the Executive Vice President for Research while retaining a strong connection to the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
We will institute a dedicated Faculty Recognition Office, reporting to the Provost, to help faculty at all career stages receive major external recognition and national and international awards reflective of their scholarly excellence and impact.
We will provide a salary supplement and other support, such as significant teaching relief, to faculty who volunteer to lead large, competitive, national center proposals, even if the proposals do not yield an immediate win.
We will provide $50,000 in discretionary accounts for principal investigators of all new awards in 2023 exceeding $5 million in total direct funding to Purdue. Upon evaluation of this pilot at the end of 2023, we may be able to continue or to expand the program in the future.
We will enable faculty members, through the Purdue Applied Research Institute (PARI) and other mechanisms being vetted, to apply for increased total compensation from external awards when permitted by the sponsor.
We will pilot a trial program that allows our faculty to use credit cards for purchasing in externally-funded research projects.
We are excited about these new and enhanced opportunities, and will seek further input from you on refinement and next steps. Your university values your hard work, creativity and excellence. Boiler Up, and welcome to 2023!
With warm wishes on behalf of the university leadership team,
Patrick Wolfe, Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Diversity

New high-tech startup developing smart contact lenses for glaucoma diagnosis and management,"summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Optometrists, ophthalmologists and their patients will benefit from new, high-tech tools to detect glaucoma at its earliest stages thanks to a startup that will commercialize smart contact lenses developed at Purdue University.
BVS Sight Inc. is the first company created through a partnership between Boomerang Ventures Studio, Purdue Foundry and the Purdue Research Foundation Office of Technology Commercialization. The partnership develops Purdue-related health care startups and health care-related intellectual property yet to reach the market.
Chi Hwan Lee, the Leslie A. Geddes Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering in Purdue’s Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, led a research team that developed new ocular technology to continuously monitor intraocular pressure (IOP) in a person’s eye. IOP is the only known modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, which can steal a person’s vision without early warning signs or pain and affects more than 80 million people worldwide, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation. Studies have suggested that IOP variability is associated with retinal structure damage that occurs in patients with glaucoma and that patients with greater IOP variability may be at higher risk for glaucoma progression.
Lee, who has worked on this technology for six years, specializes in sticktronics, which are stickerlike items that contain electronics or smart technology. His lab develops wearable biomedical devices that can continuously monitor chronic diseases or health conditions in an unobtrusive manner. Lee is BVS Sight’s co-founder and chief scientific officer. He has a joint appointment in Purdue’s School of Mechanical Engineering and courtesy appointments in the School of Materials Engineering and the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences in Purdue’s College of Health and Human Sciences.
Some of the current wearable tonometers — or devices that measure the pressure inside one’s eyes — are equipped with an integrated circuit chip, which leads to increased lens thickness and stiffness compared to a typical commercial soft contact lens, in many cases causing discomfort for patients. Lee’s version is different.
“To address this unmet need, we developed a unique class of smart soft contact lenses built upon various commercial brands of soft contact lenses for continuous 24-hour IOP monitoring, even during sleep at home,” Lee said.
“Our smart soft contact lenses retain the intrinsic lens features of lens power, biocompatibility, softness, transparency, wettability, oxygen transmissibility and overnight wearability. Having all these features at the same time is crucial to the success of translating the smart soft contact lenses into glaucoma care, but these features are lacking in current wearable ocular tonometers.”
Dr. Eric Beier, partner and chief medical officer at Boomerang, said Lee and his smart contact lens innovation piqued his and his colleagues’ interest for several reasons.
“Our interviews with optometrists and ophthalmologists demonstrated that Lee’s technology has the potential to become a new standard of care for diagnosing and managing glaucoma patients,” Beier said. “Also, founder fit is an important factor for Boomerang in determining which technologies to commercialize. In working with Lee as we evaluated his technology, we determined that he is a great fit for Boomerang and our venture studio model.
“We also liked that Lee has been very forward-thinking in developing the technology by also developing a methodology to scale up the manufacturing of his smart contact lenses.”
Beier will be a director on BVS Sight’s board and continue to support the company through his chief medical officer and management roles at Boomerang Studio.
Beier said BVS Sight must achieve several milestones to bring the smart contact lens technology to market.
“We need to optimize the integrated system for patient and clinician use: smart contact lenses, power source, eyeglasses, sleep mask and software,” Beier said. “Developing medical technologies is very complex, and the company will need to work through multiple challenges including clinical studies, regulatory approval, reimbursement and fundraising. These are all areas where Boomerang brings resources and expertise to help our portfolio companies successfully and timely navigate through these complexities.”
Beier said since the Purdue and Boomerang relationship began in 2021, Boomerang has reviewed several Purdue technologies.
“We look for technologies that meet our internal selection criteria, address important macro trends we see in health care, and clearly benefit patients and clinicians,” Beier said. “We also look for academic co-founders who are excited to work with us and enable us to leverage our business-building expertise and assets.”

"Welcome back letter from President Chiang, Provost Wolfe","summarize:Dear Purdue students, faculty and staff colleagues,
Happy New Year and a Boilermaker welcome back to Spring Semester 2023 at Purdue University. We hope you had a wonderful and restorative holiday break. As we approach this new semester, we look forward to an engaging and rewarding year of learning, discovery and engagement, and we know each of you is excited to continue your hard work toward our shared goals of growth in talent, careers and knowledge. To all of our undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff, we are committed to providing a supportive environment where you can pursue your highest aspirations – and succeed at them.
Fundamental to this success is a new initiative we are launching today: the universitywide Action Council on Student Housing and Wellbeing (SHW). This group, whose full membership is listed below, will be led by Patrick Wolfe, Provost and EVP for Academic Affairs and Diversity, and Chris Ruhl, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. It includes the presidents of Purdue Student Government and Purdue Graduate Student Government, senior leaders from across key Purdue functions, and a proud Purdue student parent. To our students, we have listened and we have heard you. We announce, effective immediately, additional investment in Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) to broaden our proactive support and fully meet student needs in counseling and psychological services. And recognizing that our master’s and Ph.D. students are the engine that powers both Purdue’s research and teaching missions, this Action Council will also focus on the important issues faced by 12,000 graduate students in West Lafayette.
To continue enhancing the vibrancy of intellectual life on campus and to celebrate the scholarly impact of our colleagues, we are organizing various events with broad participation. For example, the Presidential Lecture Series will continue, and the first speaker of 2023 will be David MacMillan, the 2021 Nobel Prize laureate in chemistry. Scheduled for 6 p.m. Feb. 13 in Fowler Hall, a separate invitation and RSVP for this open lecture will soon be sent to the campus community. Another example, with a smaller physical scale but equally exciting, are the Westwood Lectures, a monthly lecture series that will be resumed this year, featuring a wide range of our own faculty’s scholarship. A separate email will be sent to faculty in the near future.
Our listening and learning sessions with faculty will continue this semester with President Chiang, and more will be added with Provost Wolfe beginning in February. We have also scheduled town halls in which we look forward to meeting with staff and students over the coming months. These include a Jan. 19th town hall with undergraduate students, one with graduate students on Jan. 26th, and one with staff colleagues on Feb. 16th. Additional details will be forthcoming, and we look forward to learning from your perspectives, questions and aspirations.
As we begin another semester tomorrow morning, we are grateful that each of you has chosen to be here with us as a valued member of our Purdue community. One brick higher each day: Boiler Up!

"Purdue appoints senior vice president, vice provosts and interim agriculture dean","summarize:WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. —
Purdue University President Mung Chiang on Tuesday (Jan. 3) announced a new reporting structure for the senior vice president for Purdue University Online and its leadership update. At the same time, Provost Patrick Wolfe has appointed two new vice provosts and an interim dean of the College of Agriculture in the first major steps designed to shape his leadership team in guiding the academic affairs of Purdue.
The senior vice president for Purdue University Online will now report directly to the president, Chiang announced, with a dotted line to the provost. Gary Bertoline, who was appointed in April 2021 to the position, will continue to serve in the role through June 30, 2023, at which time he will take a prescheduled research leave to become the principal investigator for a major Purdue project funded by the National Science Foundation. Dimitri Peroulis, currently head of Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, will succeed Bertoline on July 1 as senior vice president for Purdue University Online.
Chiang thanked Bertoline for his outstanding leadership during two critical years of rapid growth in online education at Purdue. In guiding Purdue University Online since May 2021, Bertoline has strengthened ties with the university’s academic colleges, working closely with Purdue Global and the Office of Industry Partnerships to increase online offerings to businesses and industry. In addition, Bertoline has streamlined processes to improve efficiencies and cost savings, bolstered marketing and recruitment, and successfully created a work environment that has allowed Purdue University Online to recruit nationally where many staff work remotely while growing the number of online offerings and revenue.
In leading Purdue University Online, Bertoline has implemented two signature initiatives, one of which has been recognized as “Best-in-Class” in online education, and to create a culture known as a “Great Place to Work” for its dedicated and talented staff. In stepping away from Purdue University Online this summer, Bertoline will take a research leave to become the principal investigator on an NSF-funded grant, in collaboration with the American Society for Engineering Education and the National Academy of Engineering. The nationwide initiative will focus on developing a student-centered curriculum framework for an innovative, adaptive, diverse and inclusive engineering and engineering technology education relevant for the 21st century.
Since May 2019, Peroulis has served as the Michael and Katherine Birck Head of and the Reilly Professor in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He also has been the College of Engineering’s academic lead for online learning since January 2018. Under Peroulis’ leadership, Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering has become the nation’s largest program with 120 faculty members and 3,300 students, while achieving its strongest combined undergraduate, graduate and online rankings. Peroulis recruited 25 tenure-track/tenured faculty members and grew extramural research expenditures by 31% to a record $54 million. In addition, he led the launch of six new online graduate programs for the college, numerous credentials and increased online enrollment by nearly 2.5 times. Currently, Purdue’s online master’s programs in electrical, mechanical and industrial engineering, as well as engineering management, are ranked No. 1, while civil engineering is No. 2 in the U.S.
Provost Wolfe announced that, effective Jan. 9, Purdue’s newest vice provosts are:
Robert Frosch, who becomes vice provost for academic facilities, a newly created position. In the position, Frosch will work closely with all academic units and the Office of Administrative Operations to advance facilities for faculty and student success. Frosch joined Purdue in 1997 as an assistant professor of civil engineering. Since then, he has served in several leadership roles, most recently as senior associate dean of facilities and operations in the College of Engineering and executive director of strategic initiatives in the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research and Partnerships. His work has resulted in a master plan for engineering’s facilities, major renovation of numerous buildings and several new buildings on campus including the Flex Lab, the Bechtel Innovation Design Center and the new Dudley Hall and Lambertus Hall. His research, which focuses on the design and behavior of structural concrete, has resulted in changes to engineering practice and the building codes for both buildings and bridges. He is the recipient of the ACI Building Code Distinguished Service Award, the Concrete Research Council Arthur Boase Award and the ACI Joe Kelly Award.
David Umulis, who will serve as senior vice provost for Purdue University in Indianapolis while continuing as acting head and professor in the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. In his role as the Dane A. Miller Head, Umulis has led the Weldon School to advance discovery and translation in biomedical imaging, neuroengineering, instrumentation, computational biomedicine and engineered biomaterials. Umulis is also the director of the NSF-funded EMBRIO Institute. EMBRIO is using engineering, imaging, artificial intelligence and organismal biology to uncover mechanisms of wound healing and cellular defense. Additionally, Umulis is a member of the Purdue Teaching Academy, and he has received 2011 Richard L. Kohls Early Career Award and the 2021 Henry T. Yang Award for Leadership in Service.
Additionally, Purdue agricultural economics professor Ken Foster has been named interim dean of the College of Agriculture, beginning Jan. 9. He succeeds Karen Plaut, who will be Purdue’s new executive vice president for research. Foster, a longtime Purdue agricultural economics professor and former head of the Purdue Agricultural Economics Department, specializes in value-added market research and is heavily involved in helping small-scale farmers in Colombia and other developing countries. Foster served as Purdue’s associate head and graduate program director at Purdue from 2004-08 before his appointment as department head in 2009. He has been recognized by the Agricultural & Applied Economics Association for Distinguished Graduate, twice as a member of teams that received AAEA’s Group Extension Award, as Outstanding Graduate Faculty Mentor in the college, and the Purdue Agriculture Team Award on three different occasions. A national search for the next dean of agriculture will commence in January with a search advisory committee to be named soon.
