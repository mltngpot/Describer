Domain name registrars could be forced to take down the websites, and internet service providers could be forced to block access to the sites accused of infringing.\\nA similar law, the Protect IP Act, is making its way through the US Senate.\\nCritics argue that the proposals are too broad and could lead to the closure of a range of sites.\\nThe latest letter, published in several US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and the New York Times, reads: \"We've all had the good fortune to found internet companies and non-profits in a regulatory climate that promotes entrepreneurship, innovation, the creation of content and free expression online.\\n\"However we're worried that the Protect IP Act and the Stop Online Piracy Act - which started out as well-meaning efforts to control piracy online - will undermine that framework.\"\\nThe letter said that the legislation would require web services to monitor what users link to or upload.\\nThe bill would also \"deny website owners the right to due process\" and \"give the US government the power to censor the web using techniques similar to those used by China, Malaysia and Iran\", the letter goes on.\\n\"We urge Congress to think hard before changing the regulation that underpins the internet... Let's not deny the next generation of entrepreneurs and founders the same opportunities that we all had.\"\\nThe letter was signed by Twitter co-founders Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone and Evan Williams; Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake; Yahoo! co-founders David Filo and Jerry Yang; LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley; PayPal co-founder Elon Musk; Craigslist founder Craig Newmark; eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales.\\nAnother appeal, signed by 83 key internet engineersincluding father of the internet Vint Cerf, has also been sent to Congress.\\n\"We cannot have a free and open internet unless its naming and routing systems sit above the political concerns and objectives of any one government or industry,\" it reads.\\n\"Censorship of internet infrastructure will inevitably cause network errors and security problems. This is true in China, Iran and other countries that censor the network today; it will be just as true of American censorship.\"\\nA group of US politicians is proposing an alternative to Sopa that would see funding cut off to foreign websites accused of copyright infringements in a similar way to how the US ended Wikileaks' commercial operation.\\nThey argue that the International Trade Commission (ITC) should take charge of combating piracy, instead of judges. The ITC would be tasked with reviewing claims of online infringement against foreign website owners, ordering them cut off from funding if the claims prove true.\\nWhile the US moves to tighten its copyright laws, the UK is aiming to relax its own.\\nThe Intellectual Property Office has launched a consultation exercise intended, among other things, to allow the ripping of CDs to digital music players.\\nIt follows recommendations from Professor Ian Hargreaves inhis review of intellectual property.\\nOther plans include allowing data mining of scientific research for non-commercial use and a licensing scheme to make it easier for digital services to gain access to copyrighted works. It also proposes relaxing copyright rules around \"parody\" videos which are increasingly popular on YouTube.\\nThe move was welcomed by the British Library and watchdog Consumer Focus, but The Publishers' Association said it was concerned that the relaxation could make intellectual property theft easier.</td>\n",

It is crucial that they are listened to.\"\\nHealth Secretary Shona Robison welcomed the increase in responses to the survey, and said the feedback was \"extremely important in letting us know what is going right and where we can make improvements\".\\nShe added: \"It is welcome that staff remain committed to their roles, with almost nine out of ten willing to go the 'extra mile' at work. It is also promising that so many staff members have confidence and trust in their direct line manager, and get help and support from colleagues when needed.\\n\"However, we know there are challenges to be addressed, in particular making staff feel engaged and involved in the decisions being made within their health board.\\n\"It is vital that we learn from these findings, and I will be expecting all health boards to use their individual survey results to work with staff to bring in changes which will further improve staff experience.\"\\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said the survey \"highlights again just how short we are of nurses, and the SNP has to take full responsibility for that\".\\nScottish Labour's Dr Richard Simpson said NHS staff do \"incredible work every day\" but were \"under valued and overworked\" by the Scottish government.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Media playback is not supported on this device\\nJamie Vardy scored twice but missed out on a hat-trick by blazing a second penalty over the bar.\\nCity's longest-serving player Andy King was also on the score-sheet with Kevin Mirallas netting Everton's consolation.\\nBut this was almost a sideshow to the festivities for the Foxes' first top-flight title in their 132-year history.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nThe celebrations included a pre-match performance from Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli in front of a sold-out stadium bedecked in banners declaring the club's new status as champions of England.\\nAnd then, once the game had finished, came the moment all connected with the club had been waiting for - the lifting of the Premier League trophy.\\nIt was held aloft by captain Wes Morgan and manager Claudio Ranieri to a rapturous response from those inside the King Power Stadium and thousands more who had gathered outside the ground.\\nSaturday afternoon was billed as a title party, but for most inside the stadium the celebrations have been ongoing since Tottenham's draw at Chelsea confirmed the Foxes as the most remarkable of Premier League winners.\\nThe City players themselves only returned to training for this fixture on Thursday after being given an extra day off to revel in their stunning triumph and presumably to fully recover from a rowdy Monday night at Jamie Vardy's house.\\nFrom the moment they emerged for their pre-match warm-up, they were cheered to the rafters by supporters who had begun to mass in the stadium hours earlier to enjoy a beer on the club and revel in its greatest moment.\\nSo keen were the home fans to show their appreciation to Ranieri and his side that the Italian was forced to quieten them for the performance of Nessun Dorma by compatriot Bocelli, who received a huge ovation when he removed his tracksuit top to reveal a Leicester shirt beneath bearing his name.\\nBut despite the carnival atmosphere and a guard of honour from their opponents there was no complacency from the Foxes, who provided a fast-paced and committed finale befitting the side with the best home record in the division.\\nIf the rumoured Hollywood film of Vardy's life does come to pass it now has a superb ending, although it came within a few yards of the perfect denouement.\\nHaving missed the last two games through suspension, the 29-year-old England striker returned to the starting XI and made an instant impact, scoring with what was his first meaningful touch to steer in from King's chipped delivery.\\nA constant menace to the Everton defence, his second came from the spot after he had been tripped by Matthew Pennington.\\nBut with a dream scenario beckoning after Darron Gibson had clattered into Jeffrey Schlupp in the box, Vardy blasted his hat-trick chance high over the Everton bar from the spot.\\nWith 24 goals for the season, Vardy is now one behind Tottenham's Harry Kane in the race to be Premier League top-scorer, although he has now had a hand in more top-flight goals this season than any other player (30).\\nMidfielder King is a one-club man, the longest serving member of the Leicester squad and sole survivor of the side that won promotion from League One in 2009.\\nHis 334th career appearance only came about because of Danny Drinkwater's suspension, but the 27-year-old illustrated the reasons for his Foxes longevity with a dynamic and influential display.\\nAfter setting up the opener he was perfectly placed to latch on to a loose ball, following Riyad Mahrez's mazy run down the right, and fire his side into a commanding lead.\\nThe goal was significant for another reason, as it took Leicester's all-time league goal difference to +1 - an apt time to go into the black.\\nGiven the context of the day Everton were always in danger of being totally overshadowed, especially as they have little left to play for this season.\\nBut while the Toffees may not have needed Saturday's points, their under-pressure manager Roberto Martinez was in dire need of a proud and professional performance from his side.\\nHowever, they were far too accommodating of their opponents in the first half, essentially extending their pre-match guard of honour to allow City a match-winning hold on the game before the break.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nThey rallied slightly early in the second half, with Oumar Niasse and Romelu Lukaku drawing good saves from Kaspar Schmeichel.\\nBut when Mirallas scored a superb solo goal, which saw him run from the halfway line before beating Schmeichel in the 87th minute, many of the visiting side already seemed to be eyeing a swift exit to allow the Leicester party to get under way.\\nLeicester end their season with a trip to the team they have just deposed as Premier League champions, Chelsea.\\nEverton have two Premier League games remaining - away at Sunderland on Wednesday before a final-day home game against Norwich next Sunday.\\nMatch ends, Leicester City 3, Everton 1.\\nSecond Half ends, Leicester City 3, Everton 1.\\nCorner,  Leicester City.
